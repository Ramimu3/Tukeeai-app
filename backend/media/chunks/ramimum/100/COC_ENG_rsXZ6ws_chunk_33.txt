 In 
these cases, you need to know how to say no and revisit these proposals later. 
 
Your child's school asks for your help, and you want to decline, but you're 
worried about potential repercussions for your child. 
 
For example, you're invited to a work party, and you need to be able to say no, 
but this connection is important to you. Or when someone offers you a 
partnership where they suggest there's no need for a formal agreement, and 
you need to decline and, in fact, request: "Let's put all the terms in writing." 
 
There are plenty of situations where you need to say no, and the consequences 
are vital for your future and success. Even seemingly minor requests in your life, 
like lending a dress to someone, getting invited for dinner, or attending a 
gathering with your friends, require you to know how to say no. You should 
practice saying no effectively in these situations because this skill is crucial on 
the path to becoming Ms. President. 
 
Written Exercise 
 
I want you to write down some situations where you need professional no-
saying. You have 3 minutes for this exercise. These should be situations that are 
very important to you, and you want to practice them from now on. Make sure 
to write at least 3 examples. (I hope you won't say no to your coach's request):

How to Say No Professionally? 
 
Now, how can we say no in a way that doesn't create trouble for ourselves and 
doesn't break the other person's heart? The most professional way to say no is 
the three-step no-saying technique. This technique is used for times when your 
relationship with that person is very important, and declining a request is very 
sensitive. 
 
So, what is the three-step no-saying technique? It's a combination of three no-
saying techniques that we've put together. 
 
First Technique: Initial Accompaniment and Positive Expression of Opinion 
 
When someone requests something from you, instead of simply saying no, 
accompany them and express a positive point. For example, you can say, "Thank 
you for offering me this opportunity," or "I appreciate you choosing me for this 
request, but my answer is no." 
 
Second Technique: Saying No and Providing a Reason 
 
This means that alongside saying no, you also give a brief reason to the person. 
For instance, you can say no because you've promised someone else. You can 
say no because you have another commitment. You can say no because you 
have financial constraints. You can say no because you have different priorities 
in your life right now. 
 
Third Technique: Offering an Alternative Solution 
 
Even as you decline the request, you provide an alternative suggestion to help 
the person. For example, you can say no, but you can ask someone else for 
them. You can say no, but you can check if a bank will give them a loan. You 
offer an alternative solution so that you can still assist with solving the problem. 
 
The Three-Step No-Saying 
 
Now, when you combine these three techniques, you create an extremely 
professional way to say no that can help you navigate through very challenging 
situations. In your journey to becoming Ms. President, these situations will 
undoubtedly arise because both your relationship with others is important, and 
you know that you need to say no. 
 
The three-step no-saying technique can save you. So, let's break down each of 
these stages with examples. 
 
Stage One: Initial Accompaniment 
 
You express a positive opinion so that the other person doesn't feel negative 
from the start. This way, you can continue the conversation in a positive 
manner. For example, someone contacts you: "We're thinking about exporting. 
We want to bring dried fruits to Oman. We're short on funds. Can you lend us 
money?" 
 
Well, you didn't want to lend money. So, you can start by saying, 
"Congratulations. I hope your business goes well." 
 
A colleague asks you to cover their shift next week. They've missed their shift 
several times before, but this time, for whatever reason, you don't want to. You 
can start with, "Good news.
