 There's no need to feel embarrassed or 
aggressive; just repeat your request. 
 
When small children want something, what do they do? They keep repeating 
their request until others give in. This is precisely what you should do. When 
you've already agreed on something but are facing reluctance or a situation 
where your commitment is not being honored, you should repeat your rights. In 
most cases, this skill will help you get what you're entitled to. 
 
For example, you've given an order to a supplier, agreed that they will deliver by 
Thursday noon, but the delivery hasn't arrived. Your request is simple: "Look, 
you promised to deliver by Thursday noon. Today is Thursday, and you must 
deliver before noon. Do whatever it takes. I've committed to this, and you need 
to meet your commitment. If you don't deliver by noon, I won't need these 
items anymore. I've given you my credit card number; please refund my 
money." 
 
Often, even if you've already agreed, you may face a lack of commitment, and if 
you hesitate, your right may be ignored. Sometimes, you might have already 
agreed on a price, but now they want more money. Why? They might say the 
price has gone up during this time, the dollar exchange rate has increased, and 
so on. But what do you say? "Our agreement was for 20 dollars. I will pay 20 
dollars. Shy people usually say it once, then the other party quickly objects, 
resists, tries to manipulate, and makes you feel guilty to get you to give up your 
right. 
 
For example, it says: "Look, is it fair for me to pay for this increase in paint prices 
out of my own pocket? Tell me, but when you took money from me, you were 
supposed to buy the paints on the same day so you wouldn't have to pay more. 
So, our agreement was for you to paint for 20 Tomans. Please deliver the work 
and take your 20 Tomans. A shy person may hesitate after a short time, but 
when your request is legitimate, there's nothing wrong with repeating it again 
and again and again. 
 
A CD-R is an incredible tool; you no longer have to be like them, argue with 
yourself, get nervous. Just repeat your rightful demand over and over again and 
stand your ground.  
 
Choose your rightful statement. When you find yourself in this situation, decide 
what you want right now, what you deserve, and which sentence you should 
repeat. For example, in the matter of paint, you can say, "Our agreement was 
for it to cost 20 Tomans. I'm delivering the work, and I'll only pay you the 20 
Tomans." 
 
Sometimes the first project goes well, the second project goes well, but in the 
third project, after you deliver it, they don't pay you the agreed amount. Your 
request is this: "Look, dear employer, you said I should deliver this work, and 
you'd pay me 4 million Tomans."  
 
Don't get caught up in a new game. Often, even though they previously 
committed, they start bargaining. "Give me a discount now, and I'll become a 
customer. I don't have the money now, and I went somewhere else for a better 
price." 
 
Ladies, there's no need to engage in their game and try to prove them wrong. 
The worst thing you can do is to try to respond to these sentences in the same 
manner. Sometimes, you get provoked to give them an answer. Use the CD-R 
firmly: "Our agreement was for me to deliver this work, and you consciously 
agreed to pay me 4 million Tomans. If there was room for a discount, I would 
have applied it right away. So please pay this amount because I have prepared 
the work." 
 
They might say, "Count less so we can bring another project." Let's do the other 
one too, and we'll settle the money for all of them together. All of these are 
contrary to your initial agreement, and you should use the CD-R technique. 
Thanks for offering me more work; I hope I can work with you again, but let's 
settle this first. 
 
If you see the other party being stubborn again, arrange a face-to-face meeting. 
In that face-to-face meeting, use the CD-R technique again. Say, "We talked on 
the first day.
