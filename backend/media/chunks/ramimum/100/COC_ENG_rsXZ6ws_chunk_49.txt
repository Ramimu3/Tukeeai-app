 For example, "If you 
agree, I'll send you my bank account number for the transfer. Which bank is 
more convenient for you?" By doing this, you make the path to your desired 
outcome smoother for yourself. 
 
Where to Use These Steps? 
 
You can use these steps in personal matters, social relationships, in your 
business, and wherever you need others to help you grow and progress. This 
help can be financial, physical, time-related, or even credibility-related. In all 
these cases, the art of effective requesting can be of great help, such as when 
you need to borrow money from someone or acquire customers for your 
business. Let's review them together with examples: 
 
Step 1: State the person's name. 
Step 2: Politely ask and state your request. 
Step 3: Explain your reason. 
Step 4: Offer assurance. 
Step 5: Give them a choice and express gratitude. 
Step 6: Ask them what the next step is if they agree. 
 
By following these six steps, you can make effective requests and increase your 
chances of getting a positive response. 
 
The Use of Effective Requesting 
 
These steps are applicable in many situations, one of which is borrowing money. 
Often, you need money for the ideas you have, the big steps you want to take 
for your success, and you can obtain this money by borrowing from people, 
provided that you request it correctly and without embarrassment. 
 
Many people want to start a business, have taken classes, and now want to find 
customers, but they don't have any samples of their work. Until they have 
samples, customers won't come to them. This is where you need to ask 
someone you know to trust you and become your first customer. For example, a 
woman who specializes in interior design and decoration asks one of her 
acquaintances: 
 
"Dear friends, I had a request from you. Could I ask you to trust me and entrust 
me with the interior design and decoration of your home? I have completed a 
course in interior design and obtained my certification, and now I am fully 
prepared. But to launch my business, I need someone to trust me. You can be 
that person, and I won't charge you a fee for your trust." 
 
Ladies and gentlemen, you are finally my first customer, and not charging a fee 
is entirely natural. 
 
Now you need to provide a guarantee in the next step. How? 
 
To make sure that I will handle the job well, I can demonstrate the progress at 
each stage and show it to you for inspection, whether it's the initial design or the 
3D rendering of the work. I will also inform you at each stage, including any 
costs incurred, before proceeding with the work. 
 
Now, in the next step, you give them the choice: 
 
"Thank you very much because your trust allows me to start my business and 
become an independent woman. If you agree to this, I would be very grateful." 
 
Then give them the choice and say: 
 
"I don't need an immediate answer. Take your time until tonight and consult 
with your husband. If possible, please let me know by tonight. Thank you." 
 
When they agree to your request, the next step is to say: 
 
"So, if you agree, I'll come tomorrow morning and take measurements." 
 
My dear friends, rest assured that I will fulfill my most important business 
requests using this method. So, it's 100% effective for you. 
 
When you want to have word-of-mouth customers for your business, meaning 
customers who receive your product or service, you can ask them to introduce 
you to their circle of contacts. The approach will vary depending on your 
business. Sometimes you may ask them to provide you with the contact 
information of those who might need your product or services. At other times, 
you might ask them to make the initial contact on your behalf, send a message 
to their friends, or use other methods. In any case, with this effective requesting 
technique, you can ask them to bring you more customers. 
 
For example, you can say: 
 
"Dear Razieh, I wanted to make a request. Could you introduce me on your 
social media? Let your friends know?
