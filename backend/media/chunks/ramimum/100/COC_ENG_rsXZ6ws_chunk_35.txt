When you decide based on the ruler of behavior, it is your human right to say no. 
If you are doing the right thing, you should not allow yourself to feel guilty. In 
fact, many people in our society have the tool of making you feel guilty. 
Especially those who are a little older, they know different sentences and 
behaviors that can make you feel guilty and can control you. 
 
If you remember, we talked about it at the beginning of the book. One of the 
worst consequences of embarrassment is becoming the target of others. When 
someone deliberately or unknowingly behaves in a way that makes you feel 
guilty, you should stand up to it. 
 
Separating from the Negative Feeling of Saying No 
I want to tell you some tips so that you can distance yourself from the negative 
feeling of saying no and successfully carry out the process of saying no. Keep in 
mind that no one except yourself can help you separate from this feeling of 
guilt. So if you are sure that saying no is the right answer, keep your calm and 
say no. 
 
Don't Apologize 
You may say sorry once out of politeness, but don't repeat your apology, don't 
say sorry. Repeating an apology is not respectful at all. In saying no, a second 
apology can be very detrimental to you. 
 
First of all, it puts you in a position of weakness and allows the other party to 
possibly change you, which is very detrimental to you. But more importantly, 
reputable research has shown an interesting point about how destructive 
apologizing can be in saying no. 
 
When you repeatedly apologize for saying no, you inadvertently plant in the 
other person's mind that their request must be accepted. It means you should 
say yes, and if you say no, you have violated their right. It's not true, but your 
constant apologies create a sense of entitlement in them and make them more 
upset. So when saying no is right for you, don't apologize. 
 
Please Don't Over-Explain 
Your conversation should be very brief and clear. If you need to provide a 
reason, state your reason in one or two sentences. If you have any ambiguity, 
ask a question. Don't over-explain because it puts the other person in a situation 
where they feel worse and start feeling bad about themselves. Remember, not 
hearing a no is not easy at all. When someone requests something and you say 
no, they feel disappointed. Now, when you continue your explanations and 
justify, you constantly create a worse feeling for the other person. They have 
these questions in their mind: 
 
Why did I make this offer? What happened to me today? Why did I call this 
person? They constantly worsen their own feelings. So don't explain. 
 
Negative Aspect of Saying No and Positive Aspect of Saying No 
Sometimes, that negative feeling of guilt forces you to give up on saying no. I 
want you to look at the discussion from a different perspective. When you don't 
want or can't do something but don't say no, what negative consequences 
follow for you? 
 
I want you to ask yourself what benefit saying no has for your relationship. This 
way, you can better come to terms with yourself. 
 
You're Only Rejecting the Request 
Focus on the issue, not on the person in front of you. I repeat: you're not 
rejecting that person. That person is valuable to you. It's their request that I 
want to say no to. In your behavior, you've shown that person, "You're valuable 
to me, but it's your request that I want to say no to." 
 
Remind yourself of these sentences too: That person is valuable to me. Maybe if 
they had another request, I would say yes to it, but I have to say no to what 
they're asking for now. There's no need for me to feel guilty or ashamed in 
relation to that person. 
Make a Definitive Decision 
 
If you want your no to be successful, you need to be able to make a definitive 
decision. This is not always easy. Most people struggle with knowing what to do 
in such situations. The key question for making a decision is: Does the request 
you've been given hold value in terms of your time and attention?
