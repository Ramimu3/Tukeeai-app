 However, the first two reasons 
should demonstrate to you how important it is to put everything in writing, even 
if you are confident that your rights will not be violated. So, write it down. 
 
By "writing it down," I don't necessarily mean you have to go to a formal office. 
There are various ways to document agreements that you can use. For instance, 
when placing an order with a supplier, whether for your home or your business, 
always request a purchase receipt. If you were shown a sample, take a photo of 
that sample and send it to the other party to confirm, for example, "Is this the 
color I chose?" or "Is this the sample we agreed upon?" 
 
When the order involves voice or video calls, make sure to follow up with a 
written message stating the results. For example, in a translation matter, write 
something like, "We agreed that you would receive the translation by the end of 
Thursday. If not, it must be delivered by Friday. Otherwise, I am not obligated to 
pay you any amount." 
 
You should write down all the details of any agreement, especially your 
compensation. If the other party says, "Create a poster for me immediately," 
you should write a message like, "Mrs. X, the event poster is in these 
dimensions, right? We agreed that my fee would be 850 Toman, correct? The 
payment will be made on the same day of delivering the work, right?" 
 
When you take an order, write it down as well. For instance, if someone came to 
your salon for a haircut, selected a sample from a catalog, and said, "I want this 
one," you can take a photo of the catalog and forward it to them on WhatsApp, 
saying, "We agreed on this, correct?" 
 
When ordering clothing, write down the size, style, and all other details for the 
other party. 
 
So, remember that after any agreement, it should be documented in some way, 
and, ultimately, obtain confirmation from the other party. You can add a 
sentence like, "So, we agree on these details, right? You're okay with this 
arrangement, correct?" When you get confirmation, you can rest assured and 
avoid future disputes. By following these tips, you can handle over 90% of 
situations where your rights might be violated. 
 
When It's Not Possible to Be Precise 
You may find yourself in a situation where it's impossible to be precise, no fixed 
time or amount is determined, and you have to make an advance payment. 
 
In such cases, consider your options. Should you take the risk or not? This 
money may be lost, your work may never be completed, but you have no other 
choice. So, come to terms with it. By accepting these circumstances from the 
beginning, you won't have to worry constantly. Because you knew from the start 
that there was no other way. 
 
The Story of Istanbul Household Items 
The faintest ink is better than the strongest memory. Document your 
agreements. Many times, it can save you. 
 
During the early days of our stay in Istanbul, we ordered some household items, 
and unfortunately, we paid all the money upfront. We trusted the intermediary 
and did not insist on a precise agreement with the seller. It was our fault because 
we said we wanted these items for the following Thursday, but we didn't specify 
what would happen if they weren't delivered on time. 
 
One week and two weeks passed, and we called every day. Every day, they said, 
"Wait one more day, wait two more days." It kept getting delayed for various 
reasons. After two weeks, we decided to go to the store ourselves. There, we 
explained that these items hadn't arrived for two weeks, and our life was in 
disarray. 
 
Ladies, the truth was, the money itself wasn't the issue for us at that time. We 
had several times that amount in our account. But because we had entrusted 
the task to someone else, and they kept delaying, it had disrupted our life and 
work plans. During that period, we needed to get our affairs in order so we could 
design our business training course, produce content for Ms. President Media, 
and handle Canadian business registrations.
