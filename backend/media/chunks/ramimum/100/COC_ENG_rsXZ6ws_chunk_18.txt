 Does our body language also affect 
our inner state? In other words, if we push our chest out, lift our heads up, put a 
smile on our lips, and open our hands, does this actually generate courage 
within us? 
 
This question led scientists to design experiments and, to a considerable extent, 
prove its validity. Now, I want to describe one of these experiments to you. Yes, 
your body language has a significant impact on your inner state. 
 
 
The $50 Gambling Experiment 
 
They brought together two groups. They told the first group to display 
confident gestures, meaning raise their shoulders, open their hands, and show 
themselves as powerful. Like wrestlers or someone who has won a competition, 
raise their hands, hold their heads high, and stand straight. But for the second 
group, they told them to take on a defeated posture, frown, drop their heads, 
hide their faces, put their hands on their chest, and bend their backs. 
 
They kept both of these groups in these positions for a few minutes. They said 
they wanted to take pictures of them. But the real experiment started from this 
point onwards. 
 
They gave both groups $50 as a gift. They said, "You have a chance to 
participate in our lottery. There is a 50% chance that your $50 will double, 
making it $100. There is also a 50% chance that you'll lose it. If you agree, let's 
do it." 
 
Something interesting happened here. Many of those who had taken on the 
confident gestures said, "We want to take the risk. We have the courage for it." 
But conversely, those who had taken on the low-confidence gestures were 
much less willing to take risks. Most of them said, "No, just give us the $50; it's 
enough for us." They didn't need to resist because they had received $50 by 
chance. 
 
It was very interesting that the behavior of many of them was contrary to their 
usual habits. For example, members of the low-confidence gesture group would 
say, "We've always been into gambling, but we don't know why we didn't feel 
like taking this risk." 
 
But in the high-confidence group, there were also those who would say, "We've 
never been into risk and gambling, but now we feel like doing it." This study was 
one of the hundreds of studies that showed, yes, your outward appearance has a 
significant impact on your inner state. 
 
If you take on confident gestures before an important meeting, you'll see its 
impact on your self-confidence. Suppose you have an important business 
meeting half an hour later and need more self-confidence. You can go to a room 
or a restroom and take on a victorious posture for a few minutes by yourself. 
This small act can help boost your self-confidence, and you'll genuinely feel 
more courageous in the moment. 
 
2. Body Language Weakness: Passiveness 
 
When it comes to social self-confidence, it refers to how you face people and 
express your desires. In this conversation, you need two habits in your body 
language to become a courageous woman. However, most shy women don't 
have these two habits, and in fact, as Iranians, we all have this weakness. 
 
Eye Contact 
 
Timid women are not used to making eye contact, but when someone is talking 
to you, as a confident woman, you should establish eye contact with them. This 
shows that the person is important, and you value what they are saying. 
 
When engaged in conversation, you should maintain eye contact when making 
requests or asserting your rights, whether it's in friendly conversations or serious 
and stressful discussions. Your head should not be down, you should not be 
distracted by your phone, and your eyes should not wander around.  
 
Interestingly, timid women, when under stress or anxiety, tend to become more 
shy and avoid making eye contact. 
 
So, after reading this chapter, I want you to pay attention in the coming days to 
how much eye contact you establish when speaking with people, both close 
acquaintances and strangers. 
 
Smile 
 
Regarding body language, the second point for self-confidence in 
communication is smiling.
