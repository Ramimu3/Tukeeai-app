 They say the most valuable and entirely free gift you 
can give to people is your smile. 
 
Many women, especially those who are shy, don't smile. They don't even smile 
when they are happy. Others cannot see their joy and happiness. Therefore, you 
must learn and get into the habit of smiling in your conversations. 
 
Smiling is not just for fun and friendly gatherings. In very professional 
discussions, when your smile is on your lips, it shows how much control you have 
and how appealing and pleasant this conversation is for you. So always smile! 
 
Even in stressful situations, like when you are sitting in front of someone and 
want to assert your rights, a smile on your lips shows the other person that you 
are confident and unafraid. A smile on your lips also affects your inner state, 
making you feel more confident. 
 
I ask you to investigate this aspect in the coming days. How often do you smile 
in your conversations? What do those around you say about your smile? 
 
When You're Not Used to It 
 
Now, you have a very important question. You might say, "I'm not used to 
making eye contact. I'm not used to smiling. What should I do?" Well, I didn't 
have the habit of any confident behavior when I started on this path either. 
When I faced a stranger, everything I had learned went out of my mind. At night, 
I'd tell myself, "You knew how to express your opinion confidently, so why did 
you stay silent? You knew how to say no, so why didn't you say it? You knew 
how to present yourself effectively, so why did you sit quietly?" 
 
The most interesting memory I have of this issue was when I had just started 
teaching online classes. It was the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the 
beginning of the class, I told myself I had to make eye contact through the 
camera, but by the time the class started, I would forget. 
 
The class would end, and I'd realize I had spent the whole time reading the chat 
at the bottom of the screen or looking at the top right corner where the slides 
were. Somewhere during the session, I'd remember that I had to look at the 
camera, but by then, my words had slipped my mind. I don't want this to happen 
to you either. So, how can we develop these skills into habits? How are habits 
formed? 
 
How to Build Habits 
 
Well, let's talk about this: there are many skills we need to use to become a 
confident woman. How can we turn these into habits? 
 
I don't just mean eye contact and smiling; I mean all the techniques you learn in 
this book, like assertiveness, claiming your rights, saying no, and everything you 
need to become a confident woman. 
 
If these skills don't become part of your habits, you will never be able to use 
them in sensitive situations. 
 
For teaching this concept, I always use driving as an example. How do we learn 
skills like driving? 
 
Driving is one of those skills that on the second day, when you get out of the car 
after the lesson, you say to yourself, "I'm never going to learn this." You wish 
you were rich enough to hire a chauffeur and never have to drive. That's exactly 
what we said, and all those who attended driving classes have had this 
experience. 
 
But after a year or two, you're driving long distances, city to city, and it's 
interesting that you're on the road and not even thinking about driving. You 
think about other things, your exam, talking to someone, listening to music, and 
singing along with the singer. 
 
How did we learn it? Yes, through practice. But what I mean is, what happened 
in our brains that we mastered it? If you understand this, you can learn the rest 
of the skills in the same way. 
 
This makes some skills automatic; skills like speaking, writing, cycling, 
swimming, and skills like smiling, making eye contact, introducing yourself, and 
so on. How are they created? 
 
We've spent several months simplifying this complex scientific subject into plain 
language. I hope you can use it to build a confident character.
