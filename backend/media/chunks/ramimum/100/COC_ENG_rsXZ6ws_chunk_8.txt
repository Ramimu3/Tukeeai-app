 How much money 
have you lost due to the inability to say what you needed to say? How much 
financial opportunity have you lost because you couldn't develop your skills and 
ideas, and others have taken advantage of the same opportunity? 
 
   Write down the amount of money that has been lost. Is it 5 million Tomans? 50 
million Tomans? 500 million Tomans? Write down all of these in your 
questionnaire. For each of these five cases I mentioned, write them on a 
separate page and fill them out. 
 
 
Character Empowerment Pathway 
At the end of the first chapter, I want to review the course of the book with you 
so you know exactly what path we are going to take together. This book will 
transform you into a confident woman. As I mentioned before, to leave 
passiveness behind, you need to do two things: 
 
1. Change your roots. 
2. Learn the files. 
 
That's why our book has two parts. In the first five chapters, we'll work on the 
roots, and in the next five chapters, you'll learn communication techniques. 
Additionally, I emphasize not to miss out on the book's gifts. In total, gifts worth 
3 million Tomans have been considered for you, dear reader.

Chapter 2 
Passiveness Strikes 
Hello, Ladyboss, 
 
Welcome to Chapter 2 of the book "Character Empowerment." In this book, you 
will learn how to boost your communication self-confidence and truly become a 
confident woman. I am Razieh Mirzaei, your coach in this book and the founder 
of the Lady Boss Academy. 
 
Ladyboss, in Chapter 2, we want to see what troubles passiveness brings you. 
The more aware you become of the harms of passiveness, the more inclined you 
will be to become empowered. Your mind becomes more prepared to leave that 
passiveness behind and join the ranks of empowered women. That's why we 
want to review together the various aspects of passiveness that harm you. 
 
But at the beginning of this chapter, you will learn an incredibly practical 
technique for powerful self-expression. Let's take 5 deep breaths and start this 
chapter.

The Triple Opinion Technique 
 
One of the key indicators of low confidence is our inability to express ourselves. 
Many of us are afraid, hesitant to voice our thoughts and feelings, mainly due to 
a lack of proper communication skills. For instance, imagine you're in a group 
discussion where everyone is asked for their opinion, and you have a different 
view or point you want to express. What do you do? 
 
Most women, in such situations, remain silent, agree with others, blend in, and 
do not voice their opinions. That's why I want to introduce you to a technique 
today that will help you express your thoughts effectively: the Triple Opinion 
Technique. 
 
In the first half of the book, we didn't plan to teach you communication 
techniques. However, there are two reasons I'm teaching you this technique 
now. First, you can start using it immediately. Second, you can apply the root 
change techniques with this exercise. 
 
So, pay close attention to the components of the Triple Opinion Technique. 
 
**Fact 1, Fact 2, Opinion** 
 
An important note: "Fact" means something everyone agrees on or general 
knowledge. "Opinion" means your personal view or suggestion. For example, if 
you're asked about studying in Turkey, and you want to say it's a good idea, how 
would you say it? 
 
You would say: "First, migration is a positive step and fosters personal growth. 
Second, there are many people nowadays immigrating from Iran for further 
education, so I suggest you go for it." 
 
Now, let's reverse the scenario. You want to say that studying in Turkey is not a 
good idea. You would say: "First, Turkey's security hasn't been significantly 
better than here in recent years.
