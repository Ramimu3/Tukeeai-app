The narrative in this chapter shares an experience of having her rights violated by not receiving payment for several months while working as part of a startup team. Despite facing financial difficulties, emotional unsupportiveness from colleagues, minimal social interaction, and pressure that added to existing problems (p. 4), she remained focused on making the job successful without addressing salary concerns due to prior experiences in teaching languages and having worked at language institutes which made her believe this opportunity was a great one (p.2).

Two to three months passed with no news about their salaries, yet the manager continued providing excuses such as 'Our main business is construction projects...' or simply telling them to be patient (p. 3). This lack of communication and transparency led her teammates to sever ties with her after this incident despite knowing only her through professional contact (p.4), leaving her in difficult financial circumstances, feeling emotionally unsupported, having minimal social interaction, and dealing with the added pressure from these challenges.

The consequences were far-reaching; she lost not just her salary for those few months but also valuable time that could have been spent working on her own idea or starting a business (p. 4). Trust was broken within the organization as well due to unpaid salaries, and this experience shaped her perspective on becoming a lady boss by teaching her resilience and wisdom gained from overcoming these challenges repeatedly throughout her journey towards success (p.5).

To prevent similar situations in future professional relationships, it is essential for individuals to go through all the details with their counterparts precisely when starting any project or job, ensuring clear expectations are set regarding compensation and financial transparency (Q16), effectively communicating concerns and setting boundaries both personally and professionally (Q25 & Q30). Building strong support networks can also help navigate challenges related to professional growth and development while practicing self-reflection, learning from past experiences, and continuously improving personal and professional skills.

In summary, this story illustrates the importance of clear communication, financial transparency, setting boundaries, building a supportive network, continuous improvement, and resilience in preventing rights violations within an organization or any professional relationship. By sharing these personal stories and lessons learned, individuals can effectively address common challenges faced by women entrepreneurs while starting their businesses (Q14) and apply practical techniques like the precise timing technique and incredible CD technique to build a neural pathway for themselves that prevents future erosion of rights.
