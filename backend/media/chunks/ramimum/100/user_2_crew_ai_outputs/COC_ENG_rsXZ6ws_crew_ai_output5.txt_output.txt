1) The first fundamental problem of passiveness according to the text is that individuals lack essential files in their new brain necessary for assertion and effective communication due to past emotional experiences (so, the first fundamental problem is that in the environment of assertiveness, we don't have the right files in our new brain).
2) The second root of passiveness resides in a corner of your brain called the amygdala, responsible for emotions. This part of the brain forms connections between events and emotions (The Tale of the Brain's Corner 
Now, let's move on to the second root: the second root of passennes resides in
a corner of your brain (amygdala) responsible for your emotions).
3) Childhood experiences such as accidentally cutting one’s hand with a knife or being scolded and made fun of during group situations can cause emotional associations that lead to fear responses later on. For example, you've stored in your brain: 'knife equals pain!' due to childhood trauma (Or, for example, in childhood, you said something interesting in a group of 
people, and they scolded you and made fun of you).
4) Emotions stored in the amygdala can affect a person's behavior when faced with certain situations or environments by triggering fearful responses. For instance, if someone has an emotional association between 'group settings equals shame,' their heart rate may increase, causing them to feel uneasy and unable to communicate effectively (Another example is that in straightforward 
situations, you asked for your right).
5) The significance of the 'knife equals pain!' association mentioned in the text lies in how past emotional experiences can shape our perceptions and reactions towards certain stimuli. In this case, an individual may develop a fear response when encountering knives due to their childhood trauma (You've stored 
in that corner of your brain: knife equals pain!).
6) The author suggests that the reason why our brains associate assertion as embarrassing is because past experiences have created negative emotional associations. For example, if someone has been humiliated or embarrassed when they tried to assert their rights in a group setting before (You've stored 
in that corner of your brain: asserting your right equals embarrassment!).
7) Emotional responses impact a person’s level of consciousness during sensitive situations by reducing it, making them less able to think clearly and communicate effectively. For instance, when someone experiences 'brain freeze,' their access to long-term memory is cut off (You can't remember anything), just like when your tongue gets tied, and you don't know what to say).
8) The term 'brain freeze' refers to the fearful reactions that occur in certain social situations due to past emotional traumas. These responses may include increased heart rate, sweating, red face, and a feeling of unease (If you react this way 
in a situation, it means that corner of your brain has an issue).
9) When someone is asked for a loan but feels embarrassed or unable to say no, they might compromise their own interests. This behavior can lead them into financial difficulties later on and ruin important events like weddings (About two months later, 
it's her wedding day, but when someone asks her for a loan, she lends it to them).
10) Passiveness impacts one’s ability to communicate effectively in group settings by preventing individuals from speaking up or asserting their rights. This can lead to feelings of isolation and frustration (Whenever you feel 
you're supposed to ask or speak up in a group, that corner of your brain doesn't allow it).
11) To become more confident women, we need to change both the habitual responses stored within our brains as well as create new communication files. This can be achieved through various techniques such as practicing assertiveness and learning new skills (We have 
various techniques to dry up the roots of passennes in your mind).
12) The text suggests several methods for addressing past emotional traumas, including understanding their origins, reframing negative associations, and developing a growth mindset towards these experiences.
13) Understanding both primary roots of passiveness is crucial because it allows individuals to address the underlying causes of their fearful responses in social situations (You need 
to change both the habit on one hand).
14) Yes, emotional responses can be rewired or changed over time through conscious effort and new experiences.
15) Past childhood traumas play a significant role in shaping our adult behavior patterns related to communication and assertion by creating negative emotional associations (Can 
emotional responses be rewired or changed over time).
16) Fear of embarrassment can impact decision-making abilities, particularly when it comes to saying no or speaking up for oneself. This fear may stem from past experiences that have created strong emotional reactions and negative associations with assertion (How does 
fear of embarrassment impact a person's decision making).
17) Emotional intelligence can help individuals overcome the roots of passiveness by increasing self-awareness, empathy for others, and effective communication skills.
18) Practical steps someone could take to address their fearful responses in social situations include practicing assertion techniques, seeking support from friends or therapists, and reframing negative associations (What are some practical 
steps).
19) Our brain's response system can impact our ability to form new memories when we experience heightened emotional responses. This is because the amygdala may prioritize processing fearful stimuli over other information during stress or anxiety-inducing experiences (How does 
our brains process new info).
20) Understanding and addressing past emotional traumas can contribute towards personal growth by helping individuals develop a more balanced perspective on their experiences, learn from them, and improve communication skills.
21) Social norms play a role in shaping an individual's communication patterns and fear of embarrassment by reinforcing certain behaviors or expectations (What 
role do social norms).
22) Mindfulness practices can help individuals overcome the roots of passiveness by increasing self-awareness, reducing stress levels, and improving focus during sensitive situations.
23) Supportive relationships play a crucial role in helping someone address their fears related to communication, assertion, or speaking up for themselves (What 
role do supportive relationships).
24) Developing a growth mindset towards past emotional traumas can help individuals overcome the fearful responses and negative associations by focusing on learning from these experiences rather than being controlled by them.
25) Understanding our own patterns of behavior helps us become more confident communicators in various social situations (How does understanding 
our own behaviors).
26) Positive self-talk or affirmations can be used to challenge negative emotional associations stored within the brain's amygdala and promote a more positive perspective on oneself.
27) Taking small steps towards assertiveness and communication is an effective way of overcoming passiveness (What role does taking 
small steps).
28) Societal expectations of women contribute to feelings of embarrassment or fear when it comes to speaking up for themselves, as discussed in the text (How do societal expectations impact confidence).
29) Developing a more balanced perspective on past emotional experiences and learning from them instead of allowing them to control present behavior patterns related to communication and assertion is essential for personal growth.
30) The ability to recognize our own emotions, understand their origins, and respond effectively can help individuals overcome the roots of passiveness and become confident communicators in various social situations (How does emotional 
awareness contribute).
