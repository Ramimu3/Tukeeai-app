The text by Sushma Shankar discusses the concept of passiveness as a lack of courage or assertion skills that hinders personal growth. Through her own experiences and research, she identified external factors like societal norms and internal roots such as our ancient brain's influence on behavior and incorrect files in our new brains as causes for passive tendencies. The author emphasizes the importance of recognizing these root causes to overcome passiveness by learning effective communication skills, practicing self-awareness, seeking support from others, and developing mindfulness practices (Shankar, 2013).
