 All of this was jeopardized because 
a few household items had not arrived. 
 
So, please remember that after making any agreement, in any way possible, get 
it in writing and, ultimately, obtain confirmation from the other party. You can 
add a sentence like, "So, we agree on these details, right? You're okay with this 
arrangement, correct?" When you get confirmation, you can rest assured and 
avoid future disputes. By following these tips, you can handle over 90% of 
situations where your rights might be violated. 
After two weeks, we went there. They said that the factory responsible for 
providing your items had two partners, and they had encountered problems 
during this time. They asked for two more days to solve it themselves. We 
insisted, "Write it down; write it down right now on paper." With a pen, I wrote 
down that I would deliver the items two days later. 
 
Two days later, we went again and asked, "What happened?" They replied, "It's 
still not ready; give us one more day." We pressed further, "What if it's not ready 
by tomorrow morning?" They said, "I will refund your money." We placed the 
paper in front of them and told them to write it down, including the date, and 
sign it. I personally called them in the morning and said, "Our agreement was 
that you would return our money." We got our money back that same day. 
 
However, one lucky thing in this situation was that we hadn't paid in cash. We 
had opened a bank account during those early days, and we had transferred the 
money through bank transactions. This means we had at least a document 
showing that we had made the payment. That's how we managed to get our 
money back. 
 
This story teaches you two lessons: 
First, maybe you've lost your rights in the past when you didn't know this 
technique. Now you can go back and talk to those involved. Make a new 
agreement and put it in writing, just like the situation we encountered. We 
didn't agree from the start, and it was our mistake. But after two weeks, we did 
the right thing and resolved the issue. 
 
Second, use methods for payments that can be traced in the future. If we had 
paid in cash, we wouldn't have had any proof. 
 
Reminder and Second Confirmation 
The final step in precision is a reminder and second confirmation. After you've 
gone through the negotiation and put the result in writing, once again, get 
confirmation from the other party. Your last sentence should be something like, 
"So, we agreed on this, right? You're okay with this arrangement, correct?" Ask 
verbally one more time, and in this way, get confirmation once again. This 
behavior shows how determined you are about the agreement. 
 
If you still have concerns or feel that the other person might backtrack and 
pretend they don't remember the agreement, you can call them and say, "I 
wanted to make sure that our order is in progress. You will definitely deliver it 
next Thursday, right?" 
 
For example, a few days before, you had scheduled an in-person meeting with 
the landlord to renew the lease for the new year. You had agreed that they 
would come on Thursday evening. You can call them the night before to 
confirm, "Mrs. X, we agreed to meet at 5:00 PM at your office tomorrow, right?" 
 
This reminder ensures that even if someone has neglected their 1% carelessness 
and forgotten the agreement, you remember it and can be sure your job will be 
done. Be sure that reminders and second confirmations are your rights. 
 
Last Pottery Lesson 
Never handle important discussions via text messages. Many times, they might 
not take you seriously, or they may interpret things differently. In various 
situations, if you're upset with someone, if you want to invite an important 
person, if you want to make a proposal, or if you want to decline someone's 
offer, never do it through text messages, even if the person initiates a discussion 
with you through text or voice messages. 
 
If you ever feel that 1% doubt, your conversation is in a sensitive situation; 
always pick up the phone and talk to them.
