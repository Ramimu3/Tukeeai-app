 You become indifferent, 
but you must know that it's entirely your right. You need to know that if you 
want to make an agreement, you need to know everything about it and be 
precise in advance. 
 
It Gets Clear in the Work 
 
The other party says, "It gets clear in the work." You've probably heard this 
phrase in various situations and decided to turn a deaf ear to it, but next time, 
it's the same old story. 
 
You ask a lawyer, "How much will it cost for this case?" and they reply, "It gets 
clear in the work." A painter or designer, after taking your order and deposit, 
says, "It's not clear yet, it gets clear in the work." 
 
Another common phrase is, "We'll figure it out together. Let's become clients." 
But, we're not their clients at all. 
 
Yet, people who say these phrases are precisely the ones who make you suffer 
later. You see that after a while, they come to their terms. 
 
Another common phrase is, "I need to come and see." You ask how much it 
costs to design one of our rooms, and they say, "I need to come and see." You 
say, "Okay, how can you come?" They say, "You have to pay a deposit, and then 
I'll come." 
 
While you can't make a deposit until you know how much the cost will be. 
 
Another sentence is, "At least it will be this much." I've had it; I've spent at least 
400,000 tomans. You were told it would take at least 2 months, but now it's 
been 8 months. The other party casually says, "I said at least 2 months, but your 
project took longer." 
 
So, don't accept these sentences at all. Ask more questions. For example, say, 
"Okay, what's the normal amount? What did the last customer who had similar 
circumstances pay? What's the maximum it can be? When they say 3-4 days, 
say, "By maximum, you mean when? By the end of the week, is that certain?" 
 
To those who say, "It gets clear in the work," ask, "What's the rate? How much 
per meter? How much per hour?" 
 
Ladies, you must ask these questions to arrive at the correct figure. Don't let 
their tricks deter you. It used to happen a lot when we got into a taxi and asked, 
"How much is it to get to such-and-such place?" They would say, "Get in, how 
much is it? Let's see how bad the traffic is. How much is it?" Ask, "Okay, how 
much is the normal fare? What's the maximum? When they say 3-4 times, ask, 
'So, you mean by the end of the week? Can I be sure?'" 
 
Escaping the Art of Precision starts with small life details and ends with crucial 
life matters that determine your future. For example, a lady who was supposed 
to finish her thesis next week, defend it, and apply for a foreign scholarship at 
the end of the month saw her entire plan go down the drain because she didn't 
specify when she would receive the translated document. 
 
So, it's essential to learn the art of precision. Start with small matters, practice 
for more prominent issues, so you can confidently handle critical social 
situations. 
 
Write it down precisely 
One of the essential elements of precision in the art of negotiation is to put 
everything in writing. Don't let embarrassment keep you from asserting your 
natural rights. You can have a contract, write down the discussions on paper, 
and ask the other party to sign it. 
 
Writing things down has three benefits: 
First, it clarifies both parties' commitments at the moment of agreement. 
Perhaps there was a misunderstanding during the conversation. Writing it down 
helps identify where you may not see eye to eye or where misunderstandings 
may have occurred. By writing it down, you prevent any early mistakes. 
 
Second, it shows the other party that you are serious and that these discussions 
matter to you, and you want to have a contract. Just the act of writing it down 
makes both parties feel more committed to fulfilling their obligations. They 
become more committed on their own terms, which is ultimately in your favor 
to avoid any infringements on your rights. 
 
Third, it allows you to pursue your rights later on.
