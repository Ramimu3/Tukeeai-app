 Self-confidence is like any other skill: cooking, 
building construction plans, or driving. All these tools and skills are acquired 
through learning and practice. 
 
What is the difference between people? 
The difference between people is not in their tools and skills; it's in the secret of 
flourishing. One person learns cooking just for their family and occasional 
gatherings. Another person takes their cooking skills to a national competition, 
and a third person becomes the head chef of a five-star international hotel and 
eventually opens their own restaurant. 
 
One person uses their construction skills to build a simple hut for themselves. 
The second person takes the same skills to work on a large tower project. So, 
skills are essentially the same. What matters is how you use those skills. 
Confidence is the same for everyone; the difference is in how you apply 
maximum self-confidence techniques. You don't need supernatural powers to 
become a successful leader, it's about how you use your self-confidence. This is 
the flowering of self-confidence. 
 
So, if you want to achieve very significant and tenfold results in your life, you 
first need to master the techniques of maximum self-confidence, and secondly, 
learn how to flourish your self-confidence. 
 
All of you have undoubtedly used the secret of flourishing, even if you didn't 
realize it. 
 
Let me share a personal experience with you. During my college days in Bandar 
Abbas University, I worked as a student tutor and earned very little money. 
However, that experience boosted my self-confidence significantly. One of my 
classmates said, "We're selling cosmetics and hygiene products. You have the 
communication skills; if you join us, you can make money." I brought that self-
confidence from teaching to selling cosmetics and hygiene products and earned 
an income. The same self-confidence led me to become my own boss and resign 
from my job as an employee. If I had waited to feel supernatural powers, I might 
still have been an engineering employee. 
 
Seven months later, in Tehran, I became familiar with the insurance business 
and realized I could use the skills I had acquired in selling cosmetics and hygiene 
products in the insurance industry. The same self-confidence led me to become 
my own boss and resign from my job as an employee. If I had waited to feel 
supernatural powers, I might still have been an engineering employee. 
 
Two years later, I took the self-confidence I had gained from selling insurance 
and applied it to the world of online businesses. I attracted website design 
clients and created websites myself. I realized that with the same effort, I could 
earn ten times the income from web design. 
 
The same self-confidence, but in a different context, led to a tenfold increase in 
my income. Interestingly, website clients were seeking advice on online 
marketing, which became the stepping stone for me to enter the home-based 
business market. I wasn't a superhero, but I flourished my self-confidence in the 
right place. 
 
From my perspective, half of success lies in the techniques of maximum self-
confidence, and the other half lies in the flourishing skill of self-confidence. 
That's why my emphasis to all VIP graduates is to work on flourishing your self-
confidence, just as you've invested time in building self-confidence. You have a 
valuable tool; you just need to know how to use it to achieve extraordinary 
results in life. 
 
You can achieve anything with self-confidence, as long as you learn how and 
where to apply it for maximum impact. The big difference with the VIP program 
is that you don't just gain self-confidence; you learn how to make your self-
confidence flourish. 
 
Six months instead of six years 
 
Now, I've shared three big secrets of self-confidence with you. Now you 
understand what I mean when I say I "ate the bread of self-confidence." And if I 
could do it, you can definitely do it too, but with one big difference. This journey 
took me more than six years, but it doesn't have to take you six years. You can 
achieve the results you want in six months or less. 
 
If you want to maximize your self-confidence and be able to realize your 
dreams, I have a strong recommendation for you. Now that you've purchased 
this book and are determined to become a powerful, independent, high-income 
woman and believe you need maximum self-confidence to achieve your goals, I
