ask questions. Ask questions. Many people think that asking questions is 
unattractive, while being wrong is unattractive. 
 
Two Important Lessons About the Faulty Behavioral Cycle: 
 
1. Seek out small opportunities and use your new skills in those situations. 
2. Celebrate even the smallest successes you achieve along this path and 
congratulate yourself. 
 
The important thing is to break this faulty cycle. Small opportunities provide you 
with skills, and skills give you the enthusiasm to enter new situations. This is 
what we practice together in this book. The path to becoming a courageous lady 
is exactly this. 
 
End of Chapter Two Exercise: 
 
Ladies, we've successfully completed Chapter Two. Your final exercise for this 
chapter consists of two parts. Firstly, complete the "Harm Questionnaire" 
considering your passiveness-related harms and problems. 
 
Secondly, write more examples for the "Triple Opinion Technique." The more 
you practice, the faster you will create a positive cycle of courage for yourself. 
Start Chapter Three as soon as possible. Don't delay! I'm looking forward to it. 
Chapter Three 
Hello, Madam President, 
Welcome to the third chapter of the Character of Courage book. In this chapter, 
I want to teach you how to cultivate the habits of courageous women within 
yourself so that you naturally and comfortably behave like a courageous woman 
in various situations. 
(Slide Image) 
Which of these two ladies in the picture do you think is low on courage and 
which one is courageous? Let's review together. The lady on the right holds her 
head high, smiles, maintains eye contact, has relaxed shoulders, a straight back, 
and stands confidently. 
But how about the lady on the left? Her head is down, her face is somewhat 
hidden, her chin is tucked, her shoulders are slouched, her hands are crossed 
over her chest, and her feet are turned inward. Surely, as you compare these 
images, you feel that the lady on the right is a courageous woman, and the lady 
on the left is timid. In this chapter, we'll talk about the appearance of 
courageous women. 
Let's take five deep breaths together and start this chapter.

The Impact of Inner State on Body Language 
 
It is quite clear that our body language has an impact on others. You, yourself, 
can tell whether someone is courageous or not based on their facial expressions, 
body language, and posture, known as body language. 
 
Others look at you in the same way. Forceful and assertive people may look at 
some of you like this: 
"This lady seems courageous. Let's not mess with her. But that lady appears 
timid, reserved, and submissive; she might be an easy target." 
 
But, more importantly, our inner state is not separate from our body language, 
meaning our inner state profoundly affects our appearance. This fact has been 
tested repeatedly. 
 
Look again at the image at the beginning of the chapter. We all tend to exhibit 
certain behaviors according to our current emotional state. For instance, 
someone feeling sad may want to slouch, drop their shoulders, and round their 
back. Someone feeling scared might put their hands in front of their stomach. 
Conversely, someone feeling happy would have open hands, an upright posture, 
and a smile. 
 
So, if you spend a lot of time slouching, keeping your head down, and being in 
your own world, chances are you're either low on courage or feeling unhappy, 
tired, or anxious. All of this can be observed from your appearance. If you 
transform into a courageous woman, its impact on your appearance will become 
evident. You'll become someone with their head held high, smiling, and so on. 
 
The Impact of Body Language on Inner State 
 
Now, I want to tell you an even more crucial point. We've covered all of this to 
get to this point. We've said that your inner state affects your body language, 
but what about the reverse? 
 
This question has puzzled many scientists.
