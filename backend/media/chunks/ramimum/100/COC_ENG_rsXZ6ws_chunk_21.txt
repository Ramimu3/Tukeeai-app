 
No matter how much I practice alone, my mouth locks up when I stand in front 
of real people." 
 
If you're thinking this way, let me put your mind at ease right at the beginning of 
this book. 
 
Ladies, I now want to talk to you about the famous basketball study. This 
research has been one of the most influential studies on habit formation, 
demonstrating how mental practice affects skill improvement. 
 
The Basketball Study 
 
In this study, scientists brought in 20 soldiers who had never played basketball 
before and knew nothing about it. On the first day, they taught all of them the 
theoretical aspects of shooting a basketball into the basket. After that, they 
divided them into two groups: 
 
The first group practiced with the ball and basket for half an hour every day. 
However, the second group was not allowed to touch the ball and basket. 
Instead, they had to practice shooting the ball in their minds for half an hour 
every day. 
 
After three days, both groups had improved their skills equally. But on the fifth 
day, the group that had practiced with the basketball took the lead. That's 
natural for everyone, right? 
 
But the strange thing was what happened on the sixth and seventh days. The 
instructor came and said, "Those of you who have been doing mental practice 
only can now engage in physical practice as well." What was truly remarkable 
was that the ones who had only practiced mentally, after just one session of 
physical practice, performed much better than the ones who had been 
practicing physically for six days. They were, for example, twice as accurate. 
 
Isn't that incredibly strange? 
 
What's your takeaway from this? 
 
The basketball study shows us that mental practice alone isn't enough, but 
when you have mental practice alongside physical practice, you achieve much 
better results in real-life situations. This is excellent news for all of you. When 
you read this book alone, you have the opportunity to engage in mental 
practice. The day you find yourself in real-life situations, you'll be ahead of 
everyone else who didn't do mental practice.

The Art of Retrieving Money 
 
A while back, I searched on Google for "money retrieval." It was quite peculiar. I 
saw one of the search results saying, "Message for retrieving money," which 
means many people are looking for a message they can send to someone to get 
their money back. Even more bizarre was that people are searching for prayers 
to retrieve money! 
 
This means that people are searching for a prayer that can help them get their 
money back. Some people, to whom you lend money, may take advantage of 
you. You might even think to yourself, "I should make a mistake and stop 
helping anyone." 
 
You've made a mistake, but you need to learn from it. If you're someone who 
has lent money and hasn't received it back, you need to first learn from this 
situation. 
 
Lesson One: Learn to Say No. Much of the solution lies in refusing. In the 
following chapters, you'll learn how to say no effectively. 
 
Lesson Two: When you lend money to someone, consider the possibility of not 
getting it back. Even if the other person intends to return it, various 
circumstances can prevent them from doing so, leaving you empty-handed. 
 
Consider this before lending money: Do everything in your power so that even if 
the other person can't return 1% of it, you won't be left empty-handed.
