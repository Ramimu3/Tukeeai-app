 Ladies, when you bring up 
criticism in a group, at that moment, the person is focused on saving their 
dignity, and your criticism in the group becomes useless. So, my assertive 
behavior would likely be to write down my criticism and deliver it directly to 
them. I would write on it: 
 
"Thank you for your beautiful speech. I've learned some valuable points from 
you, but the topic you discussed is incorrect. I have expertise in this area, and I 
know the correct approach. It may mislead your participants. Therefore, I kindly 
request you to correct it." 
 
I would hand them the note after the speech, during a break, or at the end of the 
class. 
 
Deliver your criticism assertively to give them an opportunity to correct it. 
 
Mistaken Advertising 
 
I ordered a page for my business's advertising, and for some reason, it hasn't 
met my expectations. Everything might have gone as planned, but the result 
isn't what I expected. What should I do? 
 
The aggressive behavior is to start cursing and accusing them in the chat and 
WhatsApp you have, saying, "Yes, you are just another scammer. You promised 
a great return on investment. So-and-so was much better than you and charged 
one-tenth of your price. How shameless can you be! I'll go to the police 
tomorrow. If you don't refund my money within the next 24 hours, I'm going to 
such-and-such..." 
 
Timid behavior is to thank them and say nothing. Then, you might put it on your 
story, "Yes, so-and-so took my money." 
 
But assertive behavior is what will get you results. So, I would message, "Hello, 
Mrs. So-and-so, thank you for running my advertising. However, the feedback I 
received differs from what I had anticipated. I don't want to say it's your fault, 
but I wanted us to review it together to understand the cause of the problem. 
This way, we can mitigate the losses together. Thank you in advance for your 
cooperation." 
 
This is a message I can send. If I'm working through an intermediary agency, I 
can ask them to follow up for me. 
 
In this way, you can assertively express your feelings, state your opinion, and 
make your request.
