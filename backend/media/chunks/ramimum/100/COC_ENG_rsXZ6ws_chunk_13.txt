 When the mailman arrives, she has to be made up. 
 
Someone is extremely sensitive about their clothing. A tiny drop of something 
spilled on their clothes at the beginning of a party, and although no one noticed 
it, by the end of the party, they were devastated, and their mood was ruined. 
Others at the party wondered why this person was so preoccupied. Why was this 
person acting this way? Why was it so bad with us? How much comfort has 
passiveness taken away from these women? 
 
I see many women who are so sensitive about their accent and dialect that they 
have no comfort at all. When talking, every sentence they speak, they criticize 
themselves. While accents and dialects are indicators of your authenticity, they 
can still be controlled with speech techniques. 
 
How many women do I see who disturb themselves at parties because of their 
child's behavior, even when it's perfectly acceptable? A woman I know hasn't 
attended any parties since her child turned three because her child is very active. 
 
When a guest arrives, from the moment her child says hello to the guest, the 
mother's heart boils like vinegar. She can't sleep at night, and she has to take a 
pill. How much has passiveness taken away from her comfort? How much? 
 
 
 
Playing Others' Games 
 
Another subsequent downside of passiveness is that you become a pawn in 
other people's hands. A woman who feels too shy to go to the market alone 
waits for her brother to find time to accompany her. Meanwhile, her online store 
has customers waiting for her, ordering tunics, but she hasn't taken any orders 
for ten days. She hasn't had time because her brother can't accompany her to 
the market. She has become a pawn in her own passiveness. 
 
There are fickle customers who change their minds today and tomorrow. They 
constantly change their opinions. A woman whose profession is tailoring said, 
"The customer said they wanted this design in one day. I sewed it for them in 
one day. But they said no, I don't want this one; I want another one. Then, when 
it came time to pay, they promised to come and settle the bill tomorrow. 'Send 
the dress with a courier today,' they said. We waited for them, but they didn't 
show up. They said they would come next week, but they still didn't come." How 
many women are there who feel too shy to say, "Am I just a pawn in your 
game?" But they have become just thatâ€”pawns in others' games. 
 
How much have you sacrificed your time for others? People who don't value 
their own time have taken your time as well. How many times have you had a 
customer who scheduled five meetings to start a contract but then said, "No, I 
don't want to." How many times has it happened? 
 
The Masks of Passiveness 
 
Another consequence of passiveness is that it forces you to hide behind masks 
and escape from yourself. Be certain, 90 percent of women are shy, but they 
don't realize it. Why? Because their passiveness is concealed behind masks of 
falsehood. 
 
A mother who hasn't lived for herself in a long time, who hasn't cooked her 
favorite meal, taken the trips she desired, pursued her studies, or worked a job 
she wanted, all because she felt too shy to pursue her interests. If you ask her 
why her life is this way, she'll say, "Well, I'm a selfless mother!" 
 
I heard a story of a woman who hadn't spoken a word to her husband for years, 
giving the impression to others that their life was extraordinary, until one day, 
she was found in their home with a bruised and bloodied face. Her husband had 
beaten her, and everyone was astonished. Their first question was, "What did 
you do to deserve this?" It turned out her body was covered in old and fresh 
wounds. When they asked why she hadn't said anything all this time, she 
replied, "I'm a devoted wife!" 
 
Another mask says, "I'm a loyal friend." A friend says, "Let's go to such-and-such 
place." She abandons her work and goes. She says, "Come with me, be my 
guarantor." She signs the contract underneath. She says, "Lend me your 
money." She lends it.
