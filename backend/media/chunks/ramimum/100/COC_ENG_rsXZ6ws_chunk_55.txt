Chapter Ten: 
Maximum Self-Confidence 
Hello, Madam President, 
 
Welcome to Chapter Ten of the book "Character of Courage" on the subject of 
maximum self-confidence. 
 
I am Razieh Mirzaei, the founder of LadyBoss Academy, and it's my privilege to 
have taught you everything I knew in this book to help you become a 
courageous lady. When I was writing this book, I kept reminiscing about the 
early years of my life. Seven years ago, I had just arrived in Tehran and was 
striving to become a lady boss. These days, I remember the nights when I would 
go to bed feeling overwhelmed. I was under so much pressure and felt so 
powerless. But today, I am delighted that I haven't given up and have learned 
how to become a lady boss. 
 
I have included all the points from the Lady Boss Workshop in this book, so 
there's no longer any obstacle in your way. You no longer need to go through 
the same hardships. This step-by-step guide is at your disposal. So, read this 
book until you start behaving like a lady boss. 
 
Now, we've reached the final chapter of the Character of Courage book. I'm sure 
this chapter will be very valuable to you as well. In this chapter, I will show you 
what path to take after becoming courageous. Character of courage is your 
natural right, and it's essential for social life, but it's not enough for your success. 
Just like having food, shelter, and education isn't enough. You need special skills 
to maximize your self-confidence and achieve your dreams. Skills that we've 
provided for you during the VIP Lady Boss Personality course. 
 
When I set out to come to Tehran, I was in a situation much like most of you, and 
I completely understand you. At that time, I heard a story that had a profound 
impact on me. I want to tell you the story of the eaglet. 
 
The Story of the Eaglet 
On top of a mountain, an eagle had built its nest and laid its eggs. One day, 
during a fierce storm with wind and rain, a gust of wind blew one of the eagle's 
eggs out of the nest. It rolled downhill, into a field and reached the door of a 
chicken coop. The eaglet hatched among the chickens. From the day it opened 
its eyes, it found itself among the chicks. It had to peck the ground just like 
them, but it always felt that this world was strange to it and that it didn't belong 
there. It spent nights when all the little chicks were happy and sleeping soundly 
in their joyful world, while it couldn't sleep properly. 
 
The eaglet noticed it had wings. It asked the others what these wings were for, 
but they didn't know. It would often see some other birds flying with their wings, 
and one night, it dreamt of flying. The next morning, it tried to fly and fell to the 
ground. The others made fun of it, and after failing several times, it gave up. It, 
too, started pecking at the ground and behaving like a chicken. 
 
Until one day, something happened. It saw several eagles soaring high in the 
sky. While the other chicks were terrified, it said, "I want to be like them." The 
other chicks told it that it was just a chicken, and its wings were not meant for 
flying. That's when it fully realized that it was different from the others. 
 
The eaglet stood at a crossroads, facing a big decision. Should it listen to others 
saying it can't and shouldn't fly, and just watch the eagles from a distance?
