 High Confidence, and that's why we are here. I am proud of you for this 
decision. I'm sure these teachings are one of the best choices in your life. 
Something you will later say has divided my professional life before and after 
the Character of High Confidence. So let's take five deep breaths to start this 
section together.

Saying No Like Ms. High Confidence 
 
How can we say no like Ms. High Confidence? Over these 7 years, I've realized 
that for some situations, you need to firmly stand your ground and assert 
yourself wholeheartedly. Just as there are times when you need to say no and 
reject certain situations. 
 
In the journey to becoming a Ms. President, knowing when and how to say no 
becomes crucially important. The main topic of this chapter is about saying no, 
but how to say no without hurting feelings and without causing yourself 
trouble? 
 
Many situations arise where you have the right to say no. However, what we 
often see is that people usually don't say no. Why? Because they feel 
embarrassed, they get caught up in excuses, they are afraid the other person 
will be upset, or they worry about not appearing as a good person. And most 
importantly, they don't know how to say no professionally. Saying no 
professionally means clearly expressing your refusal without causing discomfort 
or offense to the other person. 
 
3 Choices for Saying No 
 
When it comes to saying no, two common wrong behaviors, especially among 
Iranian women, are prevalent. 
 
**The first wrong behavior: Suspension.** 
 
This means that you evade, run around, and give an unclear response. For 
example, a friend contacts you and asks for a loan, saying, "I'm a bit short right 
now. I'll pay you back when I receive my salary at the end of the month." What's 
your response? 
 
The common response is: "Let me check my account. I'll get back to you by the 
end of the day." But until the end of the day, you don't provide any information. 
When the person calls, you don't answer the phone, and you might even turn it 
off. A Ms. High Confidence gives a direct response, but in these situations, you 
tend to escape. 
 
What are the consequences of escaping from such situations? 
 
Firstly, you keep the other person falsely hopeful. Because you didn't say no 
clearly, they might not call someone else or request help from another source, 
and now their time is running out. You have falsely kept their hopes up, and they 
might miss their opportunity. 
 
Secondly, your credibility with that person diminishes. Afterward, they may 
view you as someone they can't rely on, and they might even speak ill of you 
behind your back. You could have avoided this by providing a direct response. 
 
**The second wrong behavior: Bread and Axe (Noon o Aeen).** 
 
The second category of people does the opposite and throws a straightforward 
no in the face of the person: No. Bread and Axe. They throw the word "no" right 
at the other person's face. This kind of saying no is inherently confrontational, 
and it damages both the other person and your relationship. A Ms. High 
Confidence always nurtures her relationships because she knows that 
relationships are an asset. 
The Ideal Behavior in Saying No 
 
Being confrontational isn't what Ms. President embodies, and being shy won't 
help you either. So, what is the ideal way to say no? 
 
Ideal no-saying is firm, respectful, and fair. In this section, I'll provide you with 
various examples because one of the best tools you have in your life toolkit is 
professional no-saying. You need it in various aspects of life. 
 
For instance, a supplier, someone from whom you buy products, offers you a 
deal: "Place a larger order, and I'll give you a much better discount." You don't 
have the budget, but you're concerned about missing out on future 
opportunities with this person. So, it's important to say no correctly. 
 
Or perhaps a colleague asks you to cover for them at work. The employer might 
offer you a new responsibility, while your current priorities lie elsewhere.
