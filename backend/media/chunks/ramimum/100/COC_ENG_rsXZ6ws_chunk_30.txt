 
 
Here, I want to ask you a question: If regret and remorse were completely 
eliminated from your life, how would you feel? 
 
Regret is for the times when you didn't express your desires and naturally lost 
them. Remorse is for the times when you had the right but didn't ask for it and 
lost it. What is the world like without regret and remorse? 
 
Imagine that when you finish this book, you have completely learned how to say 
no. That means when you say no, it creates no trouble for you, and the other 
person isn't upset, but your relationship with them even improves. 
 
Imagine being entirely skilled at not allowing your rights to be violated. 
Someone who possesses these skills no longer feels regret, no longer holds onto 
remorse. What kind of feeling do you have then? 
 
I want you to take 5 deep breaths and think about that world without regret and 
remorse of yours. Imagine it until you can feel it again.

A Very Special Point 
 
With heartfelt congratulations, the first half of the Ms. High Confidence book 
has come to an end. I want to teach you a technique here with much 
enthusiasm. I attend various training courses, and over the past few years, it has 
truly contributed to my personal growth. I have invested heavily in my 
education, both during times when my financial situation was tough and now. 
 
For example, several years ago, I learned web design, and the result was that I 
launched my own website. As soon as I arrived in Istanbul, I enrolled in 
international colleges in Canada, making the path to registering at Lady Boss 
Academy in Toronto much smoother. 
 
You surely see many people attending various training courses, but nothing 
happens in their lives. The problem lies in how people learn. Unfortunately, we 
have been educated in schools where each session taught us many new things, 
and we had to memorize everything, merely increasing our knowledge. 
However, none of these things led to a change in our lives. 
 
I've learned from this issue. When I attend a new course, I don't aim to acquire a 
thousand new things. Instead, I want to gain something that can create a 
change in my life today. That one thing might be in the first ten minutes of the 
class, it might be after the third session, or it might be towards the end of the 
course. 
 
Imagine going to a class and learning 1,000 interesting points, but how many of 
them can you implement in your life? None. However, if you only know one 
thing that you can use in your life and create a change, it's very valuable. 
 
Of course, put yourself in my shoes. As a coach, I can't just tell you that one 
thing. Thousands of people read our books and attend our academies, and each 
woman has her own specific concern. 
 
In this book, I have to include various points, but one or two of them might be 
that very special point for youâ€”the one you'll say, "It was really worth waiting 
for this book." I say for many of you, that very special point might be the three-
point assertion technique I taught you in the first chapter. Perhaps one point 
from the beginning of this chapter was that very special point you've been 
searching for for years. 
 
Find your very special point. 
 
For the exercise at the end of the first half of the book, I want you to review 
what we've covered so far. Write down your very special point, and if you'd like, 
share it with us. Direct it to the Academy's support page, leave a comment 
under the last post on my page, or post it in your story. What was that very 
special point for you? 
 
Review what we've accomplished in the first half of the book. What have we 
learned? Where have we reached? This time, be sure that your very special point 
is among these. What was it? 
 
In the first chapter, we discussed low-confidence roots and dedicated the first 
half of the book to changing low-confidence roots. In the second chapter, we 
opened up the issues of passiveness for you to be able to execute the three-
point assertion technique in detail.
