 Because she's too shy to say no, but she says, "I'm a loyal 
friend." 
 
Someone who says, "I'm an introvert." They don't engage in social situations, 
they don't connect with new people, they don't take the opportunity to present 
themselves or express their ideas. They could have seized that job opportunity, 
but they say, "I'm an introvert." However, introversion has nothing to do with 
behaviors resulting from passiveness. 
 
Introversion means that I derive energy from within, from my solitude. But it 
doesn't mean I can't use my communication skills in a group. 
 
Another mask says, "I'm humble." I ask, "Why don't you stand up and present 
yourself, share your ideas?" You could have taken that job opportunity. She 
says, "I'm humble." 
 
I adhere to traditions, another mask says. I say, "Why don't you stand up to 
claim your rights? Why do you allow yourself to be mistreated?" She says, "I 
adhere to traditions." 
 
If you're wearing one of these masks, rest assured that it's your passiveness that 
has caused you to put it on. It's so destructive that not only do you feel shy, but 
you also put on that mask, and you can't escape it. The only way is to let go of 
that passiveness. 
 
 
 
Physical Harms 
 
Another subsequent consequence of passiveness is the harms it inflicts on your 
body, mind, and thoughts. For example, a woman who claims to be on a diet can 
easily say in a restaurant, "Don't bring me these french fries; bring me more 
salad instead. And instead of sauce, bring me olive oil." But she feels too shy to 
do so. Her friends invite her to smoke to fit in and be considered a true friend, 
but she never wanted to. 
 
A woman whose friends are always partygoers decides to change her lifestyle. 
Her friends are still partygoers, and they call her every night and every week, 
inviting her out. She can't say no, and every night when she returns home, she 
feels like she's wasted her time. 
 
Negative Emotions 
 
Another severe harm that passiveness does to us is causing negative emotions 
that linger in our minds. 
 
Feelings of Anger: It's happened to everyone. You felt shy, didn't speak up, and 
your rights were violated. Then, both you and the other person become angry. 
Feelings of anger are quite common among shy individuals. It festers inside and, 
after a while, you become irritable. 
 
Feelings of Fear: New situations always trigger your fear. You become someone 
who lives with fear. 
 
Feelings of Envy: You couldn't present yourself in a way to be noticed, but you 
envy those who grow and succeed. How much do people gossip behind the 
backs of successful women? How much negativity do they spread about 
hardworking women who have achieved great positions? It's all driven by envy 
that passiveness has brought upon you. 
 
Feelings of Shame: When you fail to assert your rights, it feels like you owe 
something to yourself, and you feel ashamed. 
 
Feelings of Guilt: You could have had a better position. You could have 
progressed. You could have had a much better status, but due to some 
circumstances, you always feel guilty. 
 
Your passiveness also has significant societal consequences as it opens the door 
for arrogant individuals. Every time you don't assert your rights, the oppressors 
become stronger, and each time you step back, the bullies advance, betraying 
the society. 
 
This makes life harder for other people. Future generations are left with a 
society full of wolves, aggressors, angry, cruel, and unjust people because 
you've let your rights slip away. 
 
Feelings of Regret: How much regret lingers within us. I mentioned earlier that 
someone who has become one of the world's top surgeons still regrets not 
pursuing her dream job. A woman who is happily married with several children 
and genuinely content with her husband still regrets her single life due to her 
passiveness. There's also a lot of regret about the things we could have done but 
didn't, places we could have reached but never did. 
 
Feelings of Resentment: You say someone has wronged you, and you hate 
them.
