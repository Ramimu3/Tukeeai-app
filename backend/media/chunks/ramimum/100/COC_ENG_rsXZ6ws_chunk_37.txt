 When the other person repeats 
several times or when you know that the other person is intruding into your 
personal space deliberately, use that "No." This "No" can sometimes help you 
make the other person come to their senses sooner and rescue the relationship 
faster. 
 
Written Exercise 
Think about this: Where can you occasionally throw a "No"? I'll give you 3 
minutes starting now. 
 
Of course, "No" is not something you use all the time. It might be necessary 
once or twice a year, for example, if certain circumstances arise, and things get 
really tough, you can use that "No." 
 
Chapter Seven: 
Preventing the Erosion of Rights 
 
Hello, Mrs. President. Welcome to the seventh chapter of the book "Character 
Pardis." 
 
I am Razieh Mirzaei, your coach, and I want to dedicate this chapter to 
preventing the erosion of rights.  
 
A crucial question: How can you prevent your rights from being eroded? 
 
I want to start with a story to both emphasize the importance of the lessons in 
this chapter and impart a valuable lesson within the story. One of the first 
instances of rights being trampled that I experienced in my professional life in 
Tehran was related to the startup project "I-Langs." Take five deep breaths and 
let's begin this chapter together.

The Story of My First Experience with Rights Erosion 
 
Previously, I had shared with you the story of my entry into the world of 
business. It hadn't been long since I realized that the future of business and what 
I was looking for lay in the world of online businesses. I had no knowledge or 
skills related to it. 
 
I started learning digital marketing and the science of online marketing, 
practiced web design, attended content production and management 
workshops, and gradually understood Instagram marketing. I became involved 
in startup and online business communities. 
 
At that time, there was an event called "Contently" held weekly, a special 
gathering for content creators. The event organizers would invite a different 
expert in the field of content production and digital marketing each week. The 
guest would share their experiences, and we would ask our questions. 
Occasionally, during these gatherings, a business owner could introduce 
themselves and recruit collaborators from the audience. I attended these 
sessions every week for over a year. 
 
In one of these sessions, at the end of the program, a man in a suit and tie came 
forward and said he was the founder of the startup "I-Langs." He wanted to help 
Iranians easily learn English through the internet and become proficient in it. 
"Right now, I need a content manager." 
 
I saw this as a great opportunity. I could utilize my experience in teaching 
languages in this job. I gathered my confidence. Even though I had no 
professional experience in content production, and I didn't even have any 
management experience, I sent my resume that very night. I was even called in 
for an interview. 
 
During the interview, I presented myself with full confidence. I honestly 
admitted that I didn't have the experience but assured them that I could handle 
any task assigned to me. My entire focus was on convincing them to hire me. 
 
Ladies, you see, when after a series of consecutive failures, you reach a point 
where you're only seeking a minimal success to calm your heart, you're willing to 
prove yourself and your abilities. 
 
Starting Work at I-Langs 
 
They accepted me to start working. I didn't ask anything about my rights. I 
didn't inquire about when and how much they would pay. I simply began the 
work. We also hired four or five others for the content team. I provided them 
with some training. My job was to determine which content to publish and 
select article topics. Afterward, I supervised the editing, and of course, I had to 
liaise with the SEO manager, and all the coordination was my responsibility. 
 
In the few months that I was active, we achieved significant milestones.
