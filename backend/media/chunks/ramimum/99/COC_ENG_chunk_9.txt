 Second, Turkish universities are ranked lower 
globally compared to Iranian ones, so I think Turkey might not be the best 
choice. My suggestion is to consider European universities." 
 
Do you notice the difference in expressing your opinion? 
 
 
Facts Everyone Agrees On 
 
The first two facts are something everyone agrees on. 
 
For example, let's say the discussion is about whether to start a business in 
Istanbul or not. Now, what do I do? I don't throw my opinion out there right 
away. If I want to agree, according to the Triple Opinion Technique, I state the 
first fact, then the second fact, and then I express my suggestion. 
 
First, in Turkey, the government strongly supports startups, and its laws are 
more transparent. Second, Turkey is closely tied to Europe, which means that if 
a business takes off, it can easily expand throughout Europe. So, my suggestion 
is yes, start a business in Istanbul, and consider starting businesses that have a 
significant market in Istanbul, like fashion and tourism, or industries with 
existing markets and more facilities. 
 
Now, if you intend to disagree, do the same by stating two facts and then 
expressing your opinion. 
 
For instance, let's say the debate is about whether to sell an apartment unit I 
own or not. My opinion is not to sell it. However, instead of throwing my opinion 
out directly, I say: 
 
"Look, first, in recent years, the increase in property prices has consistently 
outpaced inflation and has provided better returns than many other 
investments. Second, you can generate income by renting the property 
yourself. So, I recommend that if you don't plan to invest the money in 
something that is undoubtedly more profitable than the property, never sell it!" 
 
Book Exercise 
 
I'd like to provide the next examples as a book exercise. Right now, I'll give you 3 
minutes to write about these scenarios. After you're done, I'll provide my 
response. But please, make an effort. Don't flip the page and perform the 
exercise. Spend these 3 minutes to: 
 
1. A woman asks you, "I want to go to work. I have a small child now, he's one 
year old. Should I go or not?" 
   ........................... 
   ........................... 
   ........................... 
 
2. One of your friends asks you, "Should I have a wedding ceremony or not?" 
Write your response right now. 
   ...........................

Whether your answer is agreement or disagreement, take 3 minutes to write 
down your opinion based on the Triple Opinion Technique. 
 
 
Exercise Answers 
 
Exercise 1: The woman asks if she should go to work despite having a one-year-
old child. I provide both perspectives. 
 
If I wanted to express disagreement, I would start by stating two facts: 
First, having the child stay with the mother during the first two years of life can 
lead to better independence later. Second, taking care of the child at night while 
managing both household and outside work can be exhausting and may lead to 
burnout. So, my suggestion is to have patience and wait at least until the child is 
2 years old. 
 
Now, if I wanted to express agreement, what would I say? 
Firstly, from my perspective, the economic situation currently requires both 
spouses to work. Secondly, staying at home for an extended period can be very 
risky for the mother and may lead to depression. So, I recommend finding work, 
and it's better to start part-time rather than being a full-time stay-at-home 
mom. 
 
Exercise 2: If I agree about having a wedding ceremony, I would say: 
"Look, first, the wedding night is just one night for most people, and it always 
leaves lasting memories. Secondly, if you don't have a wedding, you might 
regret it later. Not having wedding photos in a wedding dress can be 
disappointing. So, my suggestion is to have a modest ceremony or, if possible, a 
formal one where you can have the wedding dress and photos." 
 
If I wanted to disagree, it's not appropriate to say, "Don't have a wedding.
