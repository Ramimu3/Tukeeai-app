 
 
A champion weightlifter doesn't sit around waiting for luck to lift heavy weights. 
They work on their muscles to build the mental readiness to handle heavy 
weights and practice the techniques of weightlifting. 
 
If you want to experience high self-confidence in any area, don't wait to feel 
inner strength. In fact, as you practice building self-confidence, you will 
gradually start feeling that inner strength. One of the most beautiful results of 
self-confidence is that you eventually reach that inner strength. 
 
In this book, we have worked precisely on these two wings of self-confidence to 
help you become a courageous lady. We've also focused on mental readiness so 
you can overcome your fears. We've taught you techniques to behave like a 
courageous lady in various social situations. 
 
The first secret works in any area. Build mental readiness and take steps 
according to your roadmap. If you're looking for inner strength, invest in 
yourself, and build self-confidence to turn your dreams into reality. 
 
If you already have all the self-confidence in the world 
 
Don't confine the inner strength within you and bang it against the walls. You 
need self-confidence for a specific purpose. Is that right? You want self-
confidence for what purpose? 
 
... 
If you, like me, aspire to become a female leader, assess how much self-
confidence you possess in becoming one. What is a female leader? She is an 
independent, powerful, and high-earning woman. How confident are you in 
your independence? Do you have the mental readiness and a roadmap to 
achieve it? How about your income confidence? Are you mentally prepared with 
a roadmap to attain high income? 
 
**The Story of the Fox and the Hare** 
 
They say a fox saw a hare in the forest and chased after it. As soon as he was 
about to catch the hare, the hare said, "Oh, I am captured again. What a gloomy 
fate! I can only ask, who are you?" 
 
The fox said, "It's clear I'm a fox." The hare replied, "If you are indeed a fox and 
have the right to capture me, I am at your mercy. But just to be sure, can you 
show me some identification? Perhaps a note from the lion, for instance?" 
 
The fox replied, "I don't have any identification. I came here to hunt; I don't need 
identification." The hare said, "That's fine. If you had a handwritten note, for 
instance, from the lion, that would be enough." The fox let the hare go and went 
to the lion's den. He asked, "Lion, I need a handwritten note to prove I'm a fox 
and have the right to hunt." The lion said, "Very well. Whoever has this note is a 
fox and has the right to hunt," and he signed it. 
 
The fox took the note and returned to the hare but found that the hare was 
nowhere to be seen. He realized he had been tricked. He thought, "It doesn't 
matter; I'll keep this note in my pocket for next time." Days passed, and he saw 
the lion again, chasing after a deer. The lion caught the deer. Just as he was 
about to finish off the deer, the deer said, "Oh, I am captured again. What a 
gloomy fate!" 
 
But this time, the fox didn't bother with the hare's trick and proceeded to help 
the lion. When he was done, he said to the lion, "We never needed permits for 
hunting. Why didn't you tell me?" 
 
The lion replied, "You don't believe in yourself. You asked for another permit to 
prove you're a fox. What did you expect from me?" 
 
**Are You a Lion or a Fox?** 
 
Someone lacking self-confidence constantly procrastinates and finds decision-
making difficult. They are always in doubt, saying to themselves, "Should I do it 
or not? Should I move forward or not?" They remain indecisive and full of doubt, 
unable to commit to their actions. 
 
I know many women who have great skills but hesitate to start their own 
businesses because they fear becoming independent. Another sign of lacking 
self-confidence is undervaluing oneself. They always consider their 
achievements to be fleeting. They've seen experiences around them that 
confirm this belief. 
 
For instance, I knew a woman who ran a very successful beauty salon.
