what you do, there will always be people who find fault with you. My dear ones, 
some people divert our attention towards irrelevant matters, which prevents us 
from focusing on important issues. Some people have low self-confidence and 
make fun of or offer irrelevant opinions. I want to teach you how to deal with 
them. So, let's take five deep breaths and start this chapter together.

Ocean Art 
 
If you pour all the neighborhood grocery stores into the ocean, it won't turn into 
yogurt. The ocean is vast, and even if you throw the tallest building in the world 
into it, it won't even make a dent. It can swallow all the ships and won't even 
raise an eyebrow. 
 
The art of the ocean teaches you to be like the ocean in the face of mocking 
remarks. For instance, it tells you that your clothes are like a bathroom rug, or 
what a ridiculous idea, or that you attend silly classes. How ugly your hairstyle 
has become, how big your head is, how overweight you've become. 
 
People around us often make these baseless comments, especially about things 
you genuinely care about and work hard for, like your field of study, your career 
path, your spouse in your life, the business you want to start, the idea you've 
chosen for your future, or the country you want to immigrate to. You must let 
their words drown in you, like the ocean. 
 
Don't engage in the discussion. 
Say something that doesn't require getting into an argument. For example, they 
say your clothes are like a bathroom rug. The wrong response is to say it's not 
like a bathroom rug at all; it's very beautiful. They asked a teacher the secret of 
his calmness, and he said, "I don't argue with a fool." The right answer is to say 
yes, it may be like a bathroom rug, possibly ugly. 
 
The art of the ocean tells you to respond to such remarks with "Yes, it may be." 
 
They say you've wasted your time taking those classes, only learning nonsense? 
Say, "Yes, it may be nonsense." 
 
They say your hairstyle is really ruining your looks! Say, "Yes, it may have 
become unattractive." 
 
They say, "Seriously, what were you thinking?" Say, "Yes, maybe I need to think 
more." 
 
They say your head has gotten big! Say, "Yes, it may be big." 
 
They say you've gained so much weight! Say, "Yes, it may be overweight." 
 
Let their words drown like the ocean. 
The art of the ocean is not for responding to criticism. When you see someone 
criticizing, don't use it. It's for when they give irrelevant opinions that have 
nothing to do with you or when their intention is to mock. Here, we use the art 
of the ocean. 
 
Workbook Exercise 
 
I want to give you 3 minutes. Use the art of the ocean to respond in these 3 
situations: 
 
1. First, say you've become interested in these classes too. 
2. Second, say what has that boy said that left you speechless? 
3. Third, why should anyone be your customer at all? 
 
Start now. Afterward, I'll give my opinion so you can compare your answers with 
mine. Make sure to do this exercise to help you build the neural pathway of the 
ocean art. Begin now.

Exercise Answers 
 
Dear ones, as you can see, I showed you 3 situations that you may have 
experienced in your life. When these questions are asked, you might have felt 
uncomfortable, but when you entered the discussion and gave your answer, it 
turned into discomfort, irritation, and mental fatigue, staying with you until late 
at night. The art of the ocean helps you avoid getting into these discussions. 
 
1. First, for example, if someone wants to argue and reproach you for showing 
interest in these classes too, many of you might want to prove that you did the 
right thing and show everyone that these classes are excellent. Giving such an 
answer is a mistake. You might want to say that you knew being unashamed 
was essential, and you know you're hurting yourself and your future. He just 
throws four words at you, and you respond to it.
