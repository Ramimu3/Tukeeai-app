 Alongside that, I showed you how a lack of 
skills and avoiding situations can make you less confident and create a vicious 
cycle of low confidence. I taught you how to break the cycle of low confidence 
and create a high-confidence cycle for yourself. 
 
Next, I gave you exercises on the external characteristics of Ms. High 
Confidence. I explained how to establish eye contact and make the lip-smile 
technique a habit for yourself. 
 
In the following chapter, I taught you healthy assertiveness so that your 
behavior includes both self-expression, respect, and fairness. I taught you how 
to draw the behavior line to recognize what is right in social situations. 
 
In addition to all these things I've taught you, I've put plenty of techniques at 
your disposal. You learned the assertion technique in the very first chapter. You 
specifically practiced it for financial matters. We worked together on the 
effective three-point assertion technique and practiced asking for your rights. 
Here, we successfully concluded the first half of the book. Congratulations to 
you. 
 
The second half of the book is specifically dedicated to high-confidence 
techniques. Each session comes with techniques and exercises. For instance, in 
the next session, we are going to talk about saying no. This is the best 
educational book you could have chosen for yourself. It's the best investment of 
the year for you. Be sure of it! 
 
Now write here what your very special point is:

Chapter Six: 
Saying No, Ms. High Confidence 
 
Hello, Ms. President, 
 
Welcome to Chapter Six of the Character of High Confidence book. 
Congratulations on entering the second half of the book, where you will be 
learning practical techniques. In the second half of the book, you will learn how 
to behave in various social situations like a high-confidence woman and see 
extraordinary results in your relationships. Possessing these skills will help boost 
your social self-confidence. So let's start together, and I urge you to take the 
exercises more seriously than ever. 
 
I'm Razieh Mirzaei, your coach for this course, and what I'm sharing with you in 
these sessions is the result of my 7-year experience and interviews with over 
1,000 highly successful women. These are the skills you need to become a high-
confidence woman. The prerequisite for all your successes is these skills, which I 
will teach you in the second half of the book. Now that you've learned how to 
change low-confidence roots, it's time for high-confidence techniques. 
 
We Are Ordinary People 
 
Right at the beginning of the second section of the book, I want to tell you 
something very important. I want you to prepare to practice communication 
skills together. In this regard, people fall into three categories: 
 
1. The first category consists of those who know social etiquette and behave like 
high-confidence women from the beginning. They have been raised this way 
from the start or have learned it themselves. They now assert their rights and 
move forward. 
 
2. The second category consists of those who know nothing and don't follow 
social norms at all. These are the people we are generally not happy to be 
around, and we prefer not to get close to them. 
 
3. The third category, which includes most of us, are ordinary people. We are 
polite. We generally don't hurt anyone with our behavior unless we are in 
specific situations, such as being in a group of strangers, facing new 
circumstances, or being under pressure. In these situations, we might exhibit 
behaviors that do not align with the principles of the Ms. High Confidence 
character. Usually, our behaviors, as ordinary people, do not work entirely to our 
advantage in these special situations. 
 
But when you practice communication skills, what happens? It helps you 
become completely proficient, even in gatherings with strangers, in new 
situations, or under pressure, you can still exhibit high-confidence behaviors. 
 
We, as ordinary people, have come to the conclusion that we need to become 
Ms.
