 As long as you maintain your composure, maintain eye 
contact, and use the techniques described in the second half of the book, things 
should progress well. 
 
 
 
 
The Art of Finally Retrieving Money 
 
The last thing you can do is ask them to write it down. "I'll give it to you next 
Tuesday." 
 
"Please, just write that down for me. Your handwritten note with a signature is 
comforting." 
 
I've done this countless times, and I've always received a response. It doesn't 
matter whether you can enforce this note legally or not; what matters is that 
you show the other party that you are determined. In many cases, these actions 
breathe life into your money, and in today's society, if you get a response 70% of 
the time, that's a significant figure. 
 
So be sure to practice retrieving money with those four mental exercises, and do 
it as soon as possible. That concludes Chapter Three of the book, "The 
Courageous Character." 
 
End of Chapter 3 Exercise 
 
I've taught you exercises for eye contact. I ask you to dedicate 2 minutes daily to 
practice them. You can use your idle times; for example, practice eye contact 
while applying makeup. You can practice looking at a real picture in the metro or 
a taxi. People might give you odd looks, but that's okay. We all have plenty of 
idle moments where we can devote 10 minutes to becoming a courageous lady. 
 
Start the next chapter immediately because I want to teach you assertive 
behavior. Healthy assertive behavior means, "I respect you, and I respect 
myself." 
 
Chapter Four: Healthy Assertiveness 
 
Welcome to Chapter Four of the book "The Courageous Character." 
 
In this book, you'll learn how to boost your self-confidence in communication 
and become a courageous lady. 
 
I am Razieh Mirzaei, your coach in this book and the founder of the LadyBoss 
Academy. Here, I share my seven years of experience with you. We have 
participated in dozens of workshops in this field, read over 100 books, and 
interviewed more than 1,000 successful women. Now, we present the essence of 
it all in this book. 
 
Before writing this book, over 15,000 female leaders have attended Character of 
Courage courses and workshops, and their feedback greatly contributed to 
making this book the most practical guide. 
 
Congratulations for making it to this chapter. According to our statistics, 80% of 
those who start a book never go beyond Chapter Three. If you're here, it shows 
that you've wanted to make a change and becoming a courageous lady is 
important to you. For that, I congratulate you. 
 
This chapter of the book begins with the discussion of expressing oneself. Let's 
take five deep breaths together and start Chapter 4.

Expressing Existence 
 
Expressing existence is the pearl within the shell of your self-confidence. Just as 
divers search for pearls deep in the sea, bring them up, and reveal their beauty, 
you must work on your self-confidence and find the inner power to express 
yourself. 
 
The ability to voice your thoughts and feelings effectively and honestly is the 
fundamental definition of expressing existence. It means claiming your rights, 
expressing your thoughts, emotions, and beliefs in an impactful, direct, and 
sincere manner. 
 
Assertive Behavior 
 
Some people express themselves in a way that causes discomfort and distress to 
the other party. This is often referred to as aggressive self-expression. In our 
classes, we call it being confrontational. 
 
On the other hand, some individuals do the opposite. They either don't express 
what's inside them at all or do so in a way that doesn't allow them to assert their 
rights. This is termed passive self-expression. In our classes, we call it behaving 
timidly. 
 
What we aim for is assertive self-expression, where you not only express 
yourself but also reach your desired outcome while respecting the rights of 
others. 
 
Ms. Mirzaei, how can I tell if my behavior is assertive or not? How can I know if 
my self-expression is healthy or if I'm, for example, aggressive or passive?
