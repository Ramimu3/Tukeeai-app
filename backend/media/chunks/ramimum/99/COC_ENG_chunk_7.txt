 Files that a confident woman needs in her interactions and 
social situations. I've listed six of them here for you: 
- Saying No 
- Asserting Your Rights 
- Receiving Criticism 
- Not Apologizing Unnecessarily 
- Expressing Opinions 
 
These are the same six files that you must have as a confident woman. You need 
to spend time on them and practice. In this book, I will teach you techniques for 
each of them and be with you so that you become proficient in confident skills. 
 
 
 
The Complete Art of Overcoming Passiveness 
Right from the start, I want to ask you three questions. I want to see how serious 
you are: 
 
1. With your current situation, if you don't take this book seriously, where do you 
think you'll be next year? 
2. Can you achieve the desires that are in your mind? The ones you have? What 
happens if you don't take this book seriously? 
3. Have you ever wanted to work on your passiveness, or have you wanted to 
and it hasn't happened? 
If you haven't wanted to and still don't, neither I nor anyone else can help you. 
So, you're definitely in the right place because you want to be a confident 
woman. 
 
You can download a sample questionnaire of passiveness hits from the book's 
gifts section. 
 
Five Categories of Hits 
The hits caused by passiveness can be categorized into five categories: 
 
1. Time 
2. Energy 
3. Negative Emotions 
4. Missing Out on Enjoying Life 
5. Money 
 
I will explain each of these to you, and after finishing the chapter, I'll ask you to 
fill in each one. Let me explain each of them. 
 
1. **Time Hit** 
   A shy person can't say no to others. They are forced to accept what others say, 
and they waste a lot of their time. Here are some examples to better 
understand: 
 
   - People standing in front of you in lines constantly ask you or your colleagues 
to stand in their place, and a lot of your time is wasted. 
   - Someone who has an IELTS exam stays behind because of passiveness. They 
fall three months behind. Their acceptance is delayed by one year. A year of 
their life is wasted. 
 
   Now, take 5 minutes and write down all the times that have been wasted due 
to passiveness. The most significant time hit for me due to passiveness was 
those three years I delayed starting the LadyBoss idea. If I could have started 3 
years earlier, where would I be now? Those three years were a significant time 
hit for me. 
 
2. **Energy Hit** 
   Does passiveness take away a lot of your energy? Someone asks you to do 
something you don't want to do, and while doing that task, you lose a lot of 
energy. You can't say no; you're forced to do that task. Your right is wasted, and 
you have to spend a lot of energy to revive your rights. 
 
   You have to spend a lot of energy to reclaim your money from someone who 
didn't return it. 
    
   You should have told someone something, but you didn't, and you've been 
brooding for hours, losing a lot of energy. 
 
   Write down all the wasted energy due to passiveness. 
 
3. **Negative Emotions Hit** 
   Negative emotions make shy and timid people helpless. Why? Because 
someone who is shy is constantly having their rights violated. They are upset 
about it and angry with themselves. In front of others, they feel angry, 
embarrassed, guilty, and many other negative emotions that we will talk more 
about in the next chapter. 
 
   Write down all the negative emotions that passiveness and passiveness have 
brought into your life. 
 
4. **Missing Out on Enjoying Life Hit** 
   How much have we missed out on enjoying life because of passiveness! A very 
simple example is a woman who doesn't want to go on a trip or wants to go 
somewhere else but doesn't say it because of her passiveness. Instead of 
enjoying the trip, she's just brooding about how she should have said it. 
 
   I have felt dissatisfied for 3 months in my environment and workplace, even 
though my workplace is excellent. I haven't enjoyed life for those three months, 
even though I could have. 
 
5. **Money Hit** 
   I mentioned 12 cases that could cause you financial losses.
