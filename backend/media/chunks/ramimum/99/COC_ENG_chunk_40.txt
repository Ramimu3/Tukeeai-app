 
 
Even if you're in a situation where your pay is based on the outcome of work, for 
example, a percentage of sales, you should ask how much that percentage is. If 
it's based on the number of tasks, you should specify the fee for each completed 
task. 
 
You must also clarify the total expenses when you place an order. When you 
commission work, you'll inevitably have to pay for additional expenses. The 
exact amount of these expenses should be clear. If you're having your home's 
decoration changed, what is the fee for the design? What is the cost of the 
materials they use for the design? If you need legal representation to handle a 
case in court, what will be the lawyer's fee? If multiple sessions are planned for 
you, such as therapy or dental procedures, how many sessions are there, and 
what is the cost? 
 
Ask right from the beginning: What is the total cost? How much per session? 
How many sessions, at most, might be required? When you inquire from the 
start, you not only save yourself from hassle but also prevent potential 
violations of your rights. 
 
Precise Quality Expectations 
 
The next aspect is precise quality expectations. In some agreements, besides 
specifying the time and payment, the quality of work is crucial. For example, 
when you buy a television, ask right away if the price the seller mentioned 
includes device testing. Are the cables included? Will there be additional costs 
for things like warranty or installation later? Specify what this price entails 
precisely. Is it only for the television itself? 
 
Even when ordering something as simple as fabric, ask about the material type 
and exact color. When you define these details accurately, it puts your mind at 
ease. 
 
Clarify Consequences 
 
Finally, when you've specified all those details and expectations, you need to 
determine the precise consequences. If, for some reason, what we agreed upon 
doesn't work out, what happens next? 
 
We reached an agreement with our lawyer regarding a certain amount, and we 
asked, "Is it possible for the amount to exceed this figure?" Is there any 
additional cost involved? They said no, there are no additional costs. We asked 
again, "Does that mean there's no possibility of the expenses exceeding this 
amount?" They said it's possible in one case; if your case is rejected in the final 
stage, we'd need to make some additional filings, and this would cost this much, 
which is clearly stipulated in the contract. We reviewed it and found it 
reasonable. If you're concerned about something, you can say: "My maximum 
budget is this amount. If it goes over this, I won't pay it." 
 
In situations where creativity and taste are involved, like graphic design or 
custom clothing orders, there's always a chance that the client might not like 
the result. You should specify right from the start how you'll deliver the work, 
and if the client changes their mind along the way, what are the consequences. 
 
Maybe and However 
 
In this way, you've learned the art of being precise and addressing these four 
issues. If time is crucial, stick to a timeline. When the amount is significant, 
clarify the exact sum. Don't leave any room for "maybe" and "however." In 
places where quality matters, define your expectations precisely, and finally, 
inquire about the consequences. 
 
Ladies, you can't afford to be complacent and say, "Let it go." You might think 
that the other party has the upper hand â€“ they have the office, all the 
equipment, how can I possibly defend my rights? But, yes, when you don't 
specify, this dilemma will haunt you repeatedly. 
 
Avoiding Precision 
 
Ladies, while you practice the art of precision and want to apply it in various 
work and life situations, there are plenty of people in society who know how to 
resist your precision, even when you're being precise. It's quite common that 
you want to be precise, but the other party resists. If you let it happen, your 
inner embarrassment will make the decision for you.
