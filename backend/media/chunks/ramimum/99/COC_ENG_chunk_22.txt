 
 
A lady lent her wedding money to her friend for a month, expecting it to be 
repaid. However, her friend fell ill and couldn't communicate with anyone. 
 
While I was preparing this chapter, one of my colleagues told me that her friend 
had a family workshop, and the owner of the small workshop had told her that 
she should double the money she lent him; otherwise, he would physically harm 
her. Her friend had gone to great lengths to gather this money from different 
sources. Only 40 days were left until the due date, and she had to either come 
up with the money or face dire consequences. 
 
A shocking turn of events: 10 days later, the person who had borrowed the 
money and had it in her bank account had a fatal accident and passed away. 
According to the law, this money was frozen. First, she had to pay around 30-
40% in taxes to unlock the funds, which would take a minimum of three to four 
months. In other words, that lady lost her entire workshop, and all her efforts 
went in vain. What could she have done differently? 
 
 
 
 
Continuing with the book, I'll tell you that at the very least, you could have 
written a handwritten note stating that you lent this money for such and such 
reason, and it was agreed that it would be repaid. With such a note, you could 
have at least attempted to retrieve the money in court, but you acted timidly. 
 
So, if there's even a 1% chance that the person might not be able to repay the 
money, don't lend money without some form of guarantee. Of course, no 
guarantee is 100% foolproof. 
 
You might say, "I didn't know any better, and I made a mistake by lending the 
money. What should I do now?" 
 
Step by Step for Retrieval 
 
Now that you want to retrieve your money, the first step is to choose the right 
channel. How will you proceed? How will you reach them? Do you need to speak 
to them in person, or is a phone call enough? Or should you consider legal 
action? Determine which of these approaches is most likely to yield results 
initially. 
 
You shouldn't corner the other party in a way that makes them feel 
embarrassed. For example, don't suddenly confront them at their store's 
entrance, embarrassing them and making them defensive. Find the appropriate 
channel. 
 
Text messages and instant messaging are usually the worst ways to 
communicate. One of the worst mistakes you can make in communication is 
sending an important message via instant messaging. It conveys that your 
matter is of little value, and you don't care. When you pick up the phone and 
call, it shows that you're serious. 
 
Since I need it right now 
Please completely put aside any passiveness in these matters and ask them. 
"Hey, you borrowed this money from me and said you'd pay it back. It's been a 
month now. When can you pay it back?" 
 
"Next week." 
 
"Exactly when next week? Could you specify the day? Because I need to open an 
account for this money, and I have something important to do." 
 
Explain to them the importance of getting the money back now so that you can 
plan for its return. 
 
"Ms. [Name], just showing your seriousness can trigger a thought in their mind 
that, 'Yes, I really need this money, and it's essential.' It makes them think, 'I 
need to do something serious to repay this money.' In many cases, your 
seriousness alone can bring them to you." 
 
Go through all the details with them. Pay attention to this conversation: 
 
"When?" 
 
"The end of the week." 
 
"Okay, when on Wednesday?" 
 
"Yes." 
 
"When on Wednesday, can you call me before 5 PM?" 
 
"Yes." 
 
If you've seen any signs of procrastination or indifference, you can ask them: 
 
"Well, if you don't pay by then, what then? Can I rely on what you're saying 
anymore?" 
 
"Let me calculate it, okay?" 
 
"Sure, but when are you going to call me on Wednesday? Before 5 PM?" 
 
"Yes." 
 
If you've seen them break their word once or twice, you can consider arranging a 
face-to-face meeting.
