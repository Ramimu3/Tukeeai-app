 I wish your sister success." 
 
One of your students is a makeup artist. A colleague told you, "We're thinking of 
importing materials and cosmetics for the salon. You should partner with us. We 
have limited capital. Your materials are cheaper, and you can sell them right 
here in the salon." 
 
Now, how should you start this conversation? You can say, "Thank you for 
considering me trustworthy." 
 
We initiate the conversation with the first step. Why? Because it helps ensure 
that the other person doesn't feel bad from the beginning, and you can continue 
the discussion positively. You don't need to go into your personal life or explain 
why you don't want to. In the initial stage, you don't need to provide lengthy 
explanations. 
 
If you're in a situation where you can't explain, you can say, "I'm currently in a 
situation where I can't explain, but I'm sure you understand." If that person 
values your relationship, they will accept your reason. 
 
Often, a salesperson may offer you a product at a discount, but you're certain 
that your answer is no. There's no need to explain your personal life and why you 
don't want it. Over-explaining in this situation diminishes your stature. 
 
Stage Two: Providing a Reason 
 
You say no and briefly provide a reason. This reduces the pain of rejection for 
the other person. For example, you say no because you've promised someone 
else. You say no because you have another commitment. You say no because 
your money is tied up. You say no because you have other priorities in your life.  
 
Now, KhƒÅnum-Rais (Ms. President), if the relationship is important to you, you 
provide a reason so that the other person understands that you're not rejecting 
them for no reason. However, you don't need to exaggerate or give detailed 
explanations. In the initial stage, you don't have to. 
 
The more you explain, the more the other person may feel negative. You may 
find yourself in a situation where you can't explain everything. In that case, you 
can say, "Right now, I'm in a situation where I can't explain, but I'm sure you 
understand." If the person values your relationship, they will accept your reason. 
 
Many times, a salesperson may offer you a product at a discount, but you're 
certain that your answer is no. You don't need to explain your personal life and 
why you don't want it. Over-explaining in this situation diminishes your stature. 
 
Stage Three: Offering an Alternative Solution 
 
To show the other person that they're valuable and that it's important for you to 
help them overcome this issue, you can offer an alternative solution even as you 
decline the request. For example, you can say no, but you can check if your bank 
will give them a loan. You can say no, but you can ask someone else to help 
them. You provide an alternative solution so that you can still assist in solving 
the problem. 
 
For example, a few years ago, a friend of mine asked for a loan for his business. I 
didn't lend the money, but I found a supplier for him who was much cheaper and 
could buy the same goods with the money he had. You can ask the person 
themselves, "I don't know how I can help you. I genuinely want to assist you. 
How else can I help you?" Sometimes, when you ask, you'll find that they have 
another alternative suggestion. 
 
Written Exercise 
 
Now it's your turn. Take those examples you wrote in the previous exercise, and 
in the next 3 minutes, write down the three-step no-saying technique for each 
one. Do this exercise with full attention so that you can become proficient in this 
skill right here.

Main Barrier: Fear of Guilt from Saying No 
Now, the biggest obstacle preventing you from saying no is undoubtedly the 
feeling of guilt that you think comes from saying no. When women tell me, "But 
saying no makes me feel guilty, Mrs. Mirzai..." I reply to them, "That's not the 
case. Saying no doesn't make you feel guilty. You're making yourself feel guilty. 
These two are very different.
