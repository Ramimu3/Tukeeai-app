 She was a 
role model for all her competitors, and everyone wanted a thriving salon like 
hers. But two years later, we saw her business come to a standstill. 
 
I also knew another woman who had a great emotional life, and everyone 
admired her relationship with her husband, envying the intimacy they shared. 
She was seen as an ideal housewife. Yet, two years later, she was going through 
a divorce. 
 
You hear all these stories and think that life's achievements are fleeting, but 
that's not the reality. The key is in this concept of "unity." 
 
**The Second Secret: Unity** 
 
All the good things that have happened in my life, all the significant changes, 
whether in relationships, finances, or social status, have happened together in 
less than two years. The secret behind this rapid transformation was the 
concept of unity. 
 
Unity means that all aspects of your life are interconnected, just like different 
parts of the body. 
Imagine someone who is perfectly healthy, all their organs are functioning well, 
but they have a toothache. Can they enjoy their overall health? Can they focus? 
No. 
 
My grandmother, when she was born, had one leg that was nearly half a 
centimeter shorter than the other. Everything else about her was healthy and 
normal, except for this half-centimeter difference. Over time, that half-
centimeter became more pronounced, it affected her spine, causing her neck 
pain, and eventually, her hand stopped functioning. She developed a 
hunchback. Now, the gap between her two feet has reached 10 centimeters! 
 
Ladies, different aspects of life are interconnected, and you can't neglect the 
other aspects and say, "I only want to build a romantic and respectful 
relationship," or "I just want to grow a successful and thriving business and 
ignore everything else." They all come back to you. 
 
Let's go back to the two examples I mentioned earlier. I later realized that the 
successful salon owner had many problems in her relationships. She had ignored 
this issue for so long that it drained all her energy and even affected her 
business. Her personal problems were spilling over into her work. 
 
In the second example, the successful homemaker struggled at her job every 
day. She hated her office environment, was fed up with her work, felt stuck for 
years, and faced increasing pressure from her employer. But at the end of the 
day, she convinced herself that she had a good relationship. For a long time, she 
denied all the failures in other aspects of her life and wanted to compensate for 
them with the warmth of her relationship. The weight of this burden was so 
heavy on her shoulders and her family that it eventually damaged her 
relationship. 
 
One Bad News, One Good News 
 
One bad news about unity: You can't focus on just one aspect. Because your 
deficiencies can negatively impact the one aspect you are good at. 
 
You can't be in love but unemployed, you can't be wealthy but alone. But here's 
the good news from the unity secret: 
 
Work on any aspect of your self-confidence, and you'll see positive effects in 
other areas. A woman working on building maximum self-confidence has a 
loving and secure relationship, a thriving business, mental independence, 
financial prosperity, and this won't reverse. 
 
Secret Three: Blossoming 
 
The third secret is blossoming. I discovered this secret when I practiced the 
techniques of maximum self-confidence every day. When I found the secret of 
blossoming, I realized how much it helped me achieve results tenfold. Many 
people think that they need to be superheroes to achieve something significant 
in life, but that's not true. You only need self-confidence. But look at self-
confidence differently than what you see in the outside world. 
 
Self-confidence is not an exclusive luxury and showcase that only a few possess. 
Self-confidence is not an innate talent reserved for elites. 
 
Self-confidence is your tool and skill, just like any other tool you can learn and 
use in various aspects of life.
