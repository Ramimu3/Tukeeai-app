 I'll teach you all of them in this book. 
 
But the first step is to recognize the losses of passiveness. Practice the art of 
hitting where it hurts. This technique is one of the most effective ones that we'll 
work on together in this chapter. When you constantly remind your brain's 
corner how much you've suffered from passiveness, you gradually realize that, 
yes, being a confident woman doesn't hurt; instead, being a timid woman 
causes pain and suffering. 
 
Financial Hits of Passiveness 
In the continuation of this chapter, we will talk about 12 financial opportunities 
where passiveness has caused you losses, which are far worse than financial 
losses. 
 
I will ask you 12 questions about financial losses due to passiveness. If you've 
had these situations or something similar, give yourself a score of 1; but if you 
haven't experienced these situations, give yourself a score of 0, and then add 
them up. See how much financial damage passiveness has caused you. Today, in 
this chapter, I want to work with you on a very effective technique to rectify the 
root of passiveness. 
 
12 Questions about Financial Hits of Passiveness 
1. Someone borrowed something from you and either didn't return it or 
returned it late. It doesn't matter whether it's money, a car, clothing; in any 
case, you've suffered a financial loss. 
2. Family or acquaintances have come to you. You've done something for them, 
but they haven't paid you. 
3. You couldn't negotiate a requested salary increase at work. It doesn't matter 
whether it's a wage or a customer bonus. 
4. You didn't have a written contract, and they've raised your payment. 
5. You've invested in a one-sided relationship. 
6. You didn't ask and missed an opportunity. For example, how? For instance, 
when the stock market was booming, your friends were talking about it, and you 
were too shy to ask. When cryptocurrencies were growing, there were people 
who knew, but you were too embarrassed to ask. When everyone was starting 
online stores on Instagram and making money, you felt too shy to inquire about 
what was happening. 
7. You've spent more than your fair share. I'm not just talking about going to 
cafes. For example, in neighborly discussions or a very large party. 
8. You've entered short negotiations. For example, you made a purchase by 
mistake and told yourself that you've bought four pieces of clothing and I've 
worn them. Of course, the fifth one I don't like, but I'll buy it anyway. In any 
case, you've given it a lot of thought and found it ugly to go empty-handed. This 
issue definitely applies to homes, cars, and more. 
9. You've mistakenly become a guarantor for someone. 
10. You haven't updated your skills or ideas, and therefore, you haven't made 
any financial profit. In that case, someone else went and presented the same 
idea or skill. 
11. You haven't started a business relationship. For example, a seminar where 
you had the opportunity to speak or a job interview that you missed. 
12. Due to social courtesy, you've fallen ill and incurred medical expenses. 
 
Unfortunately, I see this last case quite often among women. For instance, a 
woman whose coworker, who was standing beside her at the paint shop, had 
lung problems. Her chair at work was bad, she always sat bent over, and she 
suffered from a spine condition, but she didn't dare say anything. Many people 
are sick, but when a guest wants to come, they're too shy to say not to come or 
to ask them to come another day. After a long time without rest, their condition 
worsens, and they end up sick. 
 
My score for the financial hits of passiveness: 
 
Note: The teachings in this book cannot replace psychotherapy and prescribed 
medications by a doctor. Do not abandon your treatment and consult with your
