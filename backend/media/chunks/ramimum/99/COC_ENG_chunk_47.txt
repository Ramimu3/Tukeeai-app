 
- Thank you for your suggestion, but this is not what I ordered. Please change it. 
 
"It's too busy today. If I take this back and bring another one, it might take 
another half an hour." 
 
"I told you from the beginning that I didn't want this. Take it back and replace it 
as soon as possible." 
 
Say it three times, say it four times, say it five times. Tell the manager. But with 
assertiveness, you can get what you want, and from all these small successes, 
these little victories, you gain motivation and self-confidence that makes a 
difference. You realize that even in these small tasks, you can achieve your 
goals, and your mood and energy improve significantly. 
 
You're in line at the bank, waiting. The person in front of you finishes their 
business, and someone from outside the line steps in. 
 
- It was my turn. Please go to the end of the line. 
- My business is very urgent. My taxi is waiting. 
- It's my turn now. Please go to the end of the line just like the rest of us. 
- My business is stuck. Come on, young man, what's the big deal if you join us? 
 
In these situations, practice assertiveness. The line is yours, it's your right. It's 
your natural right not to give your turn to someone else. Your behavior with the 
line is appropriate; so, there's nothing wrong with repeating it. 
 
Ladies, this chapter is now complete. Be sure that when you become assertive, 
you help yourself, your family, your friends, and your community. The more 
assertive you are and the more you insist, the emptier society becomes of 
people who take advantage, who are bullies and oppressors. Do it for yourself, 
for the next generation, for your entire community. 
 
Chapter Eight: Effective Requests 
 
Hello, Mrs. President. Welcome to Chapter 8 of the Character Matters book. 
 
I'm Razieh Mirzaei, the founder of Lady Boss Academy and your coach in this 
book. I know for some of you, this chapter is the most challenging, but in order 
to successfully complete this chapter, I want to share a story with you. Are you 
ready? 
 
The Story of the Ph.D. Student 
 
The story goes like this: In a university amphitheater, a group of students had 
gathered, and some of them were supposed to come up and present their Ph.D. 
dissertations. 
 
The first student came up, the second student came up, but the third student, in 
front of the professor, hesitated and wanted to leave. Right there, the professor 
stopped them, brought the microphone to their mouth, and said: 
 
"Students, this classmate of yours is saying they can't make the presentation 
because they are shy. I want to ask you a question. How many of you are shy?" 
 
Several students raised their hands. The professor selected a few of them and 
said, "Stand up and come to the stage. Introduce yourselves to the audience, 
mention your field of study, and what year you're in." 
 
The professor turned to the audience and said, "While they introduce 
themselves, I want you to rate their shyness from 1 to 10, with 10 being very shy 
and 1 being not shy at all." 
 
The first student introduced themselves but did so in a very quiet, trembling 
voice. The microphone was low, and their voice was distant. It was clear they 
were sweating, their shoulders were hunched, and it seemed like they had a 
hunched back. 
 
The professor asked, "What's the shyness score for this student?" The audience 
unanimously said, "10," indicating they were very shy. 
 
The professor asked the second student to do the same, but this time, the 
student raised their voice, but it was shaky. The professor asked, "What's the 
shyness score for this student?" The audience again said, "10." 
 
The professor asked the third student to do the same. This time, the professor 
said, "Raise the microphone higher, straighten your back, and wave your hand 
while you introduce yourself." The student did as instructed. They were still 
nervous but appeared more confident. The professor asked, "What's the shyness 
score for this student?" The audience said, "5.
