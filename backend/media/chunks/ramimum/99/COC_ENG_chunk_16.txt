 They don't use 
their arms and, as a result, their arms become weaker and weaker. It's the same 
here. You lack the skill, escape from situations, and don't acquire the skill. 
 
For example, you lack the skill of advocating for yourself, so when a customer 
comes, you either delegate the task to your colleague or keep your distance 
from the customer. This, in turn, prevents you from practicing this skill, and you 
become weaker. What is the result of this cycle? You distance yourself further 
from your work, your income decreases, your growth halts, you become more 
discouraged, and this faulty behavioral cycle continues until you shut down your 
business. 
 
Suppose someone wants to create an informative media platform, but they 
record videos infrequently and rarely update their website. When they record 
fewer videos, they naturally don't learn how to improve their video content. 
They don't create creative videos, so they don't receive positive feedback. The 
few lukewarm comments they get discourage them. As a result, they think, 
"People don't like it. Let's post videos less frequently. Actually, let's post once 
every two weeks, or maybe even once a month." 
 
Time passes, and they eventually give up on the media platform, and everything 
comes to a halt. This is the power of the faulty cycle of wrong behavior. 
 
Many of you have a habit of always letting your rights slip away. You might say, 
"The fruit vendor overcharged me; the rest of the money is yours, my dear!" The 
response you get is, "Just leave it. If I say something, it'll lead to a four-hour 
argument. I don't have the patience for it. It'll just cause trouble." 
 
See how much their courage has diminished. They've refrained from exercising 
their right to such an extent that they avoid even the smallest confrontations. 
They avoid situations as minor as getting the rest of their money from a taxi 
driver. 
 
Sudden Outbursts of Anger 
 
Suddenly, you enter a room full of people and engage in a heated argument 
with one of them. Everyone is surprised. This is the result of the faulty cycle of 
passiveness. You can start building a positive cycle of courage right now. Before 
entering real situations, you can practice at home. 
 
When you practice, you become stronger and then implement it in real 
situations. Afterward, you receive positive feedback and feel better. You 
practice more, become even stronger, and face more challenging and diverse 
situations. 
 
This way, your skills become stronger and stronger, and you become a more 
courageous person. Eventually, you find more motivation to enter extremely 
challenging situations. This helps you multiply your skills. 
 
The First Rejections 
 
I began my sales career, and some customers rejected me initially, but I didn't 
give up. The story dates back to my college days in Bandar Abbas when I sold 
cosmetics and hygiene products. I enjoyed the work and studied about sales. My 
motivation led me to approach seven or eight of our relatives. One or two of 
them placed orders. I noticed that my speech had become smoother, as if I was 
becoming more capable of handling the job. So, I went to some of my mother's 
friends. I introduced my products at language institutes where I used to teach 
and at various other places. 
 
I didn't let the initial rejections affect me negatively. I approached seven or eight 
people, but I received only one or two orders. I could have thought about the 
five or six others who said no, but I turned the cycle into a positive one for 
myself. Along the way, my presentation skills improved, and I created more 
opportunities for myself. With the sales skill I developed, I was able to start my 
own business in Tehran and successfully face extremely challenging situations. 
 
Many women tend to be trapped in the faulty cycle of passiveness when 
entering new social situations, not knowing how to behave among strangers. If 
they happen to encounter a stranger, they often make mistakes. This makes 
them less inclined to attend gatherings and mingle with strangers.
