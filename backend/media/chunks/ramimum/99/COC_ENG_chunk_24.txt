provided the test link in the book's gifts for you. Be sure to take this test to see 
your score. It gives you valuable insights. With the exercises you have in this 
book, I ask you to come back and retake this test in two weeks or a month. We 
will also provide you with the answer key. Rest assured, you will have changed. 
 
Ladies, these questions are quite specific to everyday life because they precisely 
demonstrate how courageous or timid, or confrontational we are in our daily 
actions. How we operate in our daily lives determines whether we can handle 
specific situations or not. 
 
That's why the selected questions are generally related to everyday life. 
Everyone can answer them easily and see their real score. Now, the crucial 
question is, what is the ideal behavior for a courageous lady? (Gift link) 
 
 
 
 
Ideal Behavior for a Courageous Lady 
 
Today, we need to become familiar with this. From here on, you must practice 
more and more. Our ideal behavior has three characteristics: 
 
First, expressing existence should be assertive; that means expressing your 
desires, feelings, and beliefs. 
 
Second, expressing existence should be respectful; this means respecting both 
yourself and the other party. In many relationships, you'll encounter people who 
respect themselves but not the other party; they don't care and easily insult the 
other person.  
 
Often, when you're being aggressive, it's precisely because you don't respect the 
other party, even though a courageous lady believes that all humans are worthy 
of respect. 
 
On the contrary, sometimes, you'll see ladies who highly respect the other party 
but not themselves. They might think they're worth nothing because the other 
person holds a higher position. Many times, I've witnessed ladies who have 
provided services to a doctor, architect, or even promoted a blogger. The other 
party didn't fulfill their obligations, but these ladies didn't allow themselves to 
speak up about their rights because they perceived the other person as much 
greater than themselves. 
 
So, the second thing we know is that we are also worthy of respect, just like 
others. 
 
Third, expressing existence should be fair. You need to consider real conditions. 
 
For instance, you go to a restaurant and are unsatisfied with the service. You 
express your dissatisfaction, but at the same time, you realize that the waiter 
there has completed their work on the first day and made a mistake. It 
happened once, and you consider fairness. 
 
When we launched our application, during the first week, it encountered a 
significant problem. It went offline. We considered fairness. The app design 
team made a mistake, and we overlooked it. 
 
Therefore, ideal behavior is behavior that is assertive, respectful, and fair. 
 
What is the ideal behavior for a courageous lady? 
 
Pursuing your wants and needs without infringing on the rights, values, and 
thoughts of others, until you achieve the desired outcome. 
 
Until now, we've had plenty of exercises together, and after this, we'll have 
many more to help you reach this ideal behavior. 
 
Which behavior is appropriate? Many times, I don't know what the right course 
of action is. In some situations, I get very stressed, become indecisive, and don't 
know if what I want to do is right or wrong, should I do it or not. 
 
Because all of us have roots of passiveness, this doubt makes our situation 
worse, right? 
 
That's why in this chapter, I want to give you a criterion for your behavior. 
Whenever you don't know how to do the right thing and have doubts about 
whether what you're doing is correct or wrong, you can use this criterion. 
 
 
 
How to Work with the Behavior Criterion? 
 
A lady needs money to advance her work and wants to borrow it from her 
friend, but she's hesitant about making the call or not. 
 
It's in situations like this that there's no way around it, and she doesn't know 
what to do.
