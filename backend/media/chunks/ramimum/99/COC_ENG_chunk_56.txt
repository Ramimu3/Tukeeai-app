 Or 
should it stand up, give itself a chance to discover its true power, and develop 
the courage to realize its dreams? 
 
What do you think will happen in the end of the story? Will the challenge of 
flying risk its life, or will it stand still and only watch the eagles from afar? This 
story greatly influenced me. I decided to choose the first path, and I knew that I 
needed a lot more training on this journey. Let's take five deep breaths and start

The Secret to Maximum Self-Confidence 
 
Ladies, all the good things that happened in my life, all the significant changes 
that occurred for me, whether in the realm of relationships, financial matters, or 
social status, they all happened in less than two years. And that was when I 
discovered the three secrets to maximum self-confidence. 
 
When I lacked courage, it felt like I was out of breath. But when I learned how to 
be courageous, it was as if I had just started to breathe and see the world. I 
began to ask myself what I wanted from life. It was during that time that I 
unlocked the three secrets to maximum self-confidence, and with this newfound 
confidence, my world was completely transformed. I want to show you a world 
that you can create with maximum self-confidence. 
 
For those of you who have reached the end of this book, you are familiar with 
me. You know that I have received extensive training, put in a lot of effort, faced 
numerous challenges, experienced failures, and risen above them. But whenever 
people ask me how I got to where I am today, I tell them that I feasted on the 
bread of self-confidence. 
 
Ladies, this story began three years after I arrived in Tehran. It was around my 
birthday, and at that time, I had learned many skills such as content creation, 
web design, and online customer acquisition. However, these skills were not 
translating into financial success. I had started a partnership that didn't work 
out, my confidence was shattered, my circle of influence had shrunk, and I was 
desperately searching for a solution. That's when I stumbled upon a sentence: it 
said that the only thing standing between you and your dreams is self-
confidence. 
 
I grabbed onto that clue and moved forward. I discovered three very important 
secrets that I now want to share with you. The person you see today is no longer 
the girl who embarked on this journey alone, leaving her small-town culture in 
the south behind. Today, she runs a successful business, owns several brands in 
Iran, operates an educational company in Toronto, Canada, and is working on 
internationalizing an app. But what happened? 
 
The First Secret: The Source of Inner Strength 
 
To become a powerful lady, we all need inner strength. The interesting part is 
that many people wait for this inner strength to come. They wait for it to take 
the first step toward their dreams, and they don't take action because they 
believe they don't possess this inner strength. First, you must build self-
confidence to shape your inner strength. In all these years, there hasn't been a 
day when I wasn't afraid. Fear has always been with me, weakness has always 
been within me, but I continued to take action. So, set aside this wrong 
definition. 
 
What is the practical definition of self-confidence? 
 
It means having the inclination to step towards a valuable goal, even when 
you're feeling discouraged, even when you're not sure of the outcome. In 
simpler terms, self-confidence means believing you can and then doing it. 
 
This definition consists of two parts, like the wings of a bird needed for flight. 
The first wing signifies believing in your ability and having the mental readiness, 
and the second wing signifies taking action and stepping forward. 
 
When do you feel inner strength? 
 
If you want high self-confidence, you need to strengthen both wings. A self-
confident bird flies only when it has learned how to build mental readiness and 
has a roadmap and takes action.
