 For 
example, we wrote and uploaded 200 articles in a month, and the website's 
ranking improved considerably. However, three to four months had passed, and 
there was no news about our salaries. I mentioned several times that we should 
discuss our rights. The salaries for those who were hired as content specialists 
were clear. Let's pay them. 
 
The startup manager kept coming up with excuses. On the day he introduced 
himself at that gathering, he said, "Our main business is construction projects, 
and we are financially secure. We invest our own money, so don't worry about 
finances. I want to create a large language platform." I had prior experience in 
teaching languages and had worked at language institutes, and I knew this was 
a great opportunity. That's why I focused wholeheartedly on making the job 
successful and never talked about rights. It was my own fault. 
 
Excuses from the I-Langs Manager 
 
Two to three months passed, and there was no news about our salaries. The 
startup manager claimed his money was tied up in a particular project, and the 
client hadn't deposited the payment. "Just be patient," he said. These excuses 
continued until the content team decided not to work anymore. 
 
Another manager stopped answering his phone. I didn't just lose my salary for 
these few months; I lost my time. Several months I had wanted to work on my 
own idea and start my own business. Those team members only knew me 
because they had been in contact with me. They severed their ties with me, and 
another failure was added to my previous ones.  
 
I was in difficult financial circumstances, felt emotionally unsupported, had 
minimal social interaction, and now this pressure and pain added to my existing 
problems. Why? Because I didn't know how to protect my rights. In this chapter, 
I want to share the results of my experiences with you. These are the points that 
I tested and improved over time. 
 
Ladies, it wasn't like I first had my rights violated, then learned a few skills, and 
everything changed. No, I fell into various pits again and again. This path is the 
natural route to success. To become a lady boss, you have to accept that there 
are many challenges along your journey. Each time, I became stronger than 
before. Each time, I became wiser than before. 
 
The points I'm teaching you need to be practiced over and over again. Apply 
those mental exercises I provided to you to all of these techniques to build a 
neural pathway for yourself. Then, you'll no longer allow your rights to be 
eroded, and you'll confidently move forward on the path to success. 
Preventing Rights Violation Techniques 
 
On the path to becoming a lady boss, you need to gradually master various 
techniques. Today, I've chosen three techniques that are the most practical and 
can be quickly learned and applied in various situations. Undoubtedly, a 
situation similar to the story I shared has happened to you and will happen 
again. You'll face challenges. 
 
I'll work on the precise techniques with you. I'll teach you the timing technique 
and provide you with the incredible CD technique. You can master these 
techniques today, as long as you completely set aside your timidity and become 
a bold lady. 
 
My dear friends, these techniques are not only useful for sensitive social 
situations but also for everyday matters. They prevent many troubles and won't 
allow you to tolerate everyday frustrations. So, you'll have more peace in your 
life. 
 
Precise Timing Technique 
 
If you want to prevent your rights from being violated, from the very beginning, 
you must go through all the details with the other party precisely. I remember in 
the early days when the air conditioner in my house was broken. I called a 
specialist, and he inspected it, saying a particular part was damaged and needed 
to be replaced. It would cost 400,000 Tomans. At that time, my financial 
situation wasn't good at all.
