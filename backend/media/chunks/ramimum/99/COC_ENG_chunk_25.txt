 Well, she should apply this behavior criterion. 
 
If I call the person now, will it make me feel better? Yes, even if they don't lend 
me the money, I'll still feel better because I've taken a positive step towards my 
goal. 
 
Will it harm the other person? If I don't make the call and miss this opportunity, 
it would harm me, so it's better to make the call. 
 
Is my behavior effective? If I learn the proper way to request a loan, then my 
contact is certainly effective, and if the person has the means, they will lend me 
the money. 
 
Is it ethical? If everyone I interact with behaves this way, would the world be a 
better place? Definitely! If people help each other, especially in situations where 
I want to start a business, it creates added value, money circulates, and maybe I 
can even employ a few people. Clearly, the world would be a better place. 
 
Does it inconvenience anyone? No, certainly not. If the person lends me the 
money, it's understood that eventually, when we agree, I'll return the money to 
them, so I'm not causing any inconvenience. After all, they're lending me money 
they're not using. If they needed it, they could say no, and there's no pressure on 
them. 
 
So, based on this, I'll make the call and borrow the money. I have no guilty 
conscience or sense of wrongdoing. 
 
For example, if you've agreed with someone that they will come in 10 days to 
redecorate your office. Today, they've taken the money, measured, and said 
they'll come back in 10 days to do the work. They even deliver it in one day. 
 
Now, is it okay for you to say, "Let's just write down what you said together"? Is 
this the right thing to do? 
 
Later, I'll teach you about negotiation skills, but naturally, you might feel 
hesitant. You should ask yourself: 
 
Will doing this make me feel better in the short term? Yes, having this document 
in my hand will make me feel better. 
 
Will it harm me? No, because having this document gives me peace of mind, and 
I won't feel cheated. At the very least, writing it down creates a commitment for 
the other party. 
 
Is my behavior effective? Yes, when I put a contract in writing, the other party 
becomes more committed. If someone has a half-cup of something, they might 
get a little scared, and I understand it. 
 
Is it ethical? This depends on your own ethical principles. 
 
But if nobody helps anyone, and everyone says no to each other, would the 
world be a better place? No, it wouldn't be a better place. So, you need to think 
more about whether this behavior is right or not. 
 
Someone who avoids attending new gatherings might have these pretexts and 
says, "I'm an introvert, and my communication skills are weak." 
 
They have plenty of excuses and avoid going to any new gatherings. Now, based 
on the behavior criterion, we can evaluate it: 
 
Does this action make me feel better in the short term? Yes, but in the long 
term, it makes me feel lonelier. 
 
Will it harm me? No, when I avoid, I don't experience the stress, but later, when I 
see others progressing due to their interactions, it definitely harms me. 
 
Is my behavior effective? No, by avoiding, I never get out of this situation, so this 
behavior is not effective. 
 
These three aspects help you understand that avoiding attending new 
gatherings is not the right behavior for a lady leader. 
 
In the same way, whenever you're in severe doubt and hesitation and don't 
know what the right course of action is, use this behavior criterion. Ask yourself, 
"Would a courageous lady like me behave this way?" Always keep this behavior 
criterion in mind. 
 
Many times, when customs, routines, and passiveness bother us, this behavior 
criterion comes to our aid. 
 
It's a great idea to keep these five questions in your wallet for a while. Create a 
small card and put it in your wallet. Look at it inside your wallet so that you can 
make important life decisions right there and prevent routines and customs. 
Learn the right behaviors as a courageous lady in very important and crucial 
situations.
