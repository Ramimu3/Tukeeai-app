 You don't need to argue; you 
don't need to explain. It's simple; the art of the ocean says to respond with "Yes, 
it may be that I've made myself interested." 
 
2. Second, what has that boy said that left you speechless? You might have 
experienced something like this at least once. However, the correct response, 
with the art of the ocean, is something like, "Yes, maybe I've become silent 
because of his words. Yes, maybe many people think I've become silent." 
 
3. Third, why should anyone be your customer at all? A trick many people use, 
whether for mockery or to dishearten you, is to ruin your decision. Ladies, when 
you use the ocean art, you don't need to provide a reason afterward, like saying 
that maybe no one will become my customer, it's okay, I'll learn. This is a 
mistake. But don't bring it up. The art of the ocean says to let their words drown 
in you, like the ocean. 
 
Combining Assertive Techniques 
 
Ladies, when you practice various techniques, you can achieve extraordinary 
results by combining them. In the book's gifts, I've included a video on how to 
use the art of the ocean to enhance the previous techniques in the book. Watch 
the gift video right now to be more effective in various situations.

Dealing with Criticism 
 
We've come to the topic of criticism. One of the essential skills you need for 
being a high-achieving lady is the ability to manage criticism. How do you 
handle criticism that comes your way? Where and how should you offer criticism 
if necessary? 
 
Facing criticism is not a pleasant experience at all. It's bothersome for everyone, 
and no one likes to be criticized because none of us want to make mistakes, 
have flaws in our work, or give a subpar performance. We don't want to mess 
up, and we certainly don't want someone to see our mistakes and faults and 
point them out. But if you want to overcome embarrassment, you must learn 
how to deal with criticism because sometimes past criticisms and fear of future 
criticisms hold you back and prevent you from moving forward. Criticism is a 
challenge you may prefer to avoid. 
 
Right now, recall the last time you received serious criticism. When was it? Think 
about exactly how you felt in that moment, whether you were upset. 
Regardless, criticism will be a part of your journey to success.  
 
The Golden Brick 
 
Many people view criticism as a brick hurled at them. You shouldn't just stand 
there and let it hit you, but you shouldn't dodge it either. You need to catch that 
brick and put it to good use. Look at it as if there are gold coins hidden inside 
each of those bricks. If you catch the brick, break it open, and extract the gold 
coins, they become yours. 
 
From our perspective as high-achieving ladies, the criticisms directed at us are 
like gifts. Why? Because they reveal truths to us that, if attended to, can lead to 
our improvement. Criticisms drive change, positive change when we see where 
our mistakes lie and can work on improvement. We must learn to view them this 
way. 
 
Those who have been following us for over a year have witnessed our constant 
pursuit of change. This character book you're currently viewing might be the 
fourth or fifth iteration of the Lady High Achiever workshop. We've created it 
from scratch and altered its contents each time. We conduct a survey after every 
book, creating an environment for you to provide criticism. Because these 
criticisms make us better and better. So, I encourage you to see the criticisms 
directed at you as gifts. Today, you'll learn how to manage criticisms and extract 
those golden coins from them. 
 
Out of Envy and Malice 
 
Another question arises: some people criticize out of envy and malice. 
Nevertheless, they are still criticizing, and within those criticisms lie gold coins 
for you. Who better than a jealous or spiteful person to find your mistakes and 
bring them to your attention? Even if it's wrong, and even if it creates tension, 
let's focus on the positive aspect so that you can claim the gold coins.
