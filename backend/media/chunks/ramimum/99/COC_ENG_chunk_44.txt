 After agreeing, send the result in 
writing. But never leave important matters in text messages. This habit will save 
you from many conflicts. 
 
Written Exercise 
Now it's your turn. Write down situations where you could have prevented your 
rights from being violated using the precision technique. Write down at least 3 
situations and then describe what steps you would have taken in those 
situations. Finally, write down how you would have put your agreement in 
writing. I'll give you 3 minutes. Go ahead and do the exercise now.

The Art of Buying Time 
 
My dear readers, the second skill I'd like to teach you in this chapter is the art of 
buying time. Many times, you find yourself in situations where you can't make a 
quick decision. For example, someone makes a request, and you're not sure 
whether to say yes or no. Or even more importantly, you're not sure how to 
decline the request without offending someone. It's your natural right to buy 
some time in these situations. Instead of blurting out a yes or no without 
thinking, you buy time. 
 
Sometimes, you receive a tempting offer, and you feel excited about it. But 
deep down, you're afraid that the decision you make might not be entirely 
correct. 
 
In such situations, the art of buying time comes to your rescue. You can ask for 
more time from the other person. In these moments, it's easy to say, "Thank 
you, but I need some more time to think about it." 
 
When you're asked for something, whether it's borrowing money or making a 
commitment, you can respond with statements like: 
 
- "I don't want to make any promises I can't keep, so let me refrain from 
answering right now." 
- "I don't want to say something I might regret later. Let me take some time to 
consider it." 
- "Right now, I can't evaluate all aspects of this thoroughly." 
 
These suggestions can apply to various work-related discussions or even when 
someone proposes a partnership or a joint venture. These offers might be 
enticing, but you may need to assess your priorities before making a decision. 
You can simply say, "Give me some time to check a few things. Can you give me 
a couple of hours?" 
 
Ladies, buying time is not about procrastination. Whenever you need to think, 
you buy time and provide your final response in due time. For instance, if 
someone asks you to reply within 10 minutes, you can call back after 10 minutes 
and say, "Thank you for your offer. I've considered it, and my answer is no, or 
this is not something I can decide within 10 minutes. Let's discuss it tomorrow 
morning." 
 
A crucial point to remember is that you should never handle important 
discussions through messages. If you feel that your conversation is sensitive or 
that someone might backtrack on their commitment without any 
accountability, make a call. After reaching an agreement, follow up with written 
confirmation. Never address important matters through text messages; this 
habit can save you from many conflicts. 
 
Written Exercise 
 
Now it's your turn. Write down situations where you could have used the skill of 
buying time. List at least three scenarios. These can be situations you've 
encountered before or ones that you often come across in your work. Then, 
write down which of the provided phrases you would use to buy time. Take 
three minutes to complete this exercise.

The Art of Assertiveness 
 
The skill of assertiveness is for situations when you have a legitimate right, but 
you see that right being ignored or dismissed, and you want to claim it. This skill 
is straightforward and comes with a few fine-tuning points that I will explain in 
this chapter. You should not be embarrassed; instead, you should use it 
confidently. 
 
Think of it as being like a scratched CD. In the past, when CDs had scratches, 
they would keep repeating the same part of the song. You need to do the same 
with your legitimate requests. Repeat your request over and overâ€”two times, 
three times, or even ten times.
