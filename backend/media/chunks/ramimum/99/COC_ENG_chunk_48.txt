" 
 
Finally, the professor asked the same of the fourth student. This time, the 
student introduced themselves confidently, raising their voice, straightening 
their back, and waving their hand. The professor asked, "What's the shyness 
score for this student?" The audience said, "3." 
 
The lesson here is that none of these students were inherently shy. They had 
simply developed a habit of shyness. They had become accustomed to 
exhibiting timid behaviors. However, those behaviors could be corrected right 
there. 
 
So, the point is, you are not shy; you have simply developed a habit of behaving 
timidly. You've gotten used to the wrong behaviors, and they can be corrected 
right away. 
The fourth person introduced themselves, and the professor said to them, 
"Now, after you've introduced yourself, smile and say, 'I'm very pleased to be of 
service to you and to take another step forward.' They did just that, and it was 
said: 2. 
 
To the fifth person, the professor said, "If you can introduce yourself in such a 
way that your embarrassment score is 1 right now, I will give you a perfect score 
for this class right away." The fifth person was the doctoral student who didn't 
want to present and kept saying they were embarrassed. The professor said, "To 
help you, I want you to do one more thing. Open and close your mouth 
completely." The student did just that, and everyone applauded. The professor 
asked, "What's your embarrassment score?" They all said: 1. 
 
What do we learn from this story? None of us are really shy, but we've become 
accustomed to feeling embarrassed. I want you to ask yourself a question. Do 
you want to remain shy, or is it time to become a confident person? Let's take 
five deep breaths and start Chapter Eight together. 
 
Chapter 8: The Art of Effective Requesting 
 
Now, it's time to learn the art of effective requesting. One of the most 
significant advantages of overcoming shyness is the ability to express your 
needs, emotions, and desires. I want to teach you how to request effectively, 
meaning you have a way to influence the other person to act fairly and say yes 
to your request, not no. 
 
Some people respond aggressively to any request, while others might feel 
embarrassed and reject your proposal if they don't understand it properly. If you 
want results, these six steps I'm going to teach you today can help you make 
effective requests. 
 
Six Steps for Effective Requesting 
 
The importance of each of these steps may vary depending on the significance 
of your request. Sometimes, you may not need all six steps. Let's go over each 
of them with examples: 
 
Step 1: State the person's name. Everyone has heard their name since 
childhood. It's a pleasant way to address someone, and it makes the 
conversation more friendly. For example, "Mr. Smith," "Ms. Johnson," "Dear Ali," 
or "Razieh, my dear." 
 
Step 2: Politely ask, "May I request...?" and then state your request. For 
example, "May I request a loan of ten million Tomans from you tonight, with a 
repayment by the end of the month?" 
 
Step 3: Explain your reason. When you provide a reason for your request, the 
chances of it being accepted increase threefold. For example, "I need fifty 
million Tomans to open my boutique. I already have forty million, and I'm short 
ten million. If you lend me this amount, I will make sure to repay it by the end of 
the month, clearing all my debts." 
 
Step 4: Offer assurance. When you talk directly about providing assurance, you 
demonstrate that your words can be trusted. You might say, "I'm willing to 
provide any necessary guarantee." 
 
Ladies, you can even offer the guarantee yourself. For example, you could say, "I 
can even offer a promissory note for this loan." 
 
Step 5: Give the other person a choice, and don't pressure them. Thank them 
and say, "I appreciate your assistance. If it's possible for you, please let me 
know." 
 
Step 6, the crucial step: Ask the person what the next step is if they agree. If 
they say they're willing, tell them what the next step is.
