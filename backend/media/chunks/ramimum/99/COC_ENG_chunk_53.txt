 
 
Now, I want you to think again. Recall the last time someone found one of your 
problems or flaws out of envy or malice and criticized it. If you knew how to 
handle that moment correctly, how much would the situation have changed? 
How beneficial would it have been if you knew how to catch the brick, break it 
open, and extract the gold coins from within? So, let's practice together how to 
manage criticisms. 
 
Managing Criticism 
 
You can handle any criticism using this 5-step formula. The goal of this 5-step 
formula is to ensure that when someone criticizes you, not only does the other 
person feel better, and your relationship remains intact, but also that these 
criticisms do not hit you like bricks, causing you harm. Instead, you should be 
able to catch the criticism, break it open, and extract the gold coins from within. 
Pay close attention to these 5 steps: 
 
Step 1: Effective Listening 
In simple terms, don't interrupt the person criticizing you, even if what they're 
saying is wrong. If you immediately think of what to say to make the other 
person feel better, don't say anything and listen. Use your body language, eye 
contact, and smiles to convey that the other person's words matter to you. For 
example, one of my students told me, "Mrs. Mirzaei, the clothes you wear 
during class are not cheerful and girly." But another student's criticism was the 
opposite. She said, "Why don't you wear heavier clothes that show more respect 
for our class?"  
 
Step 2: Expressing Gratitude for the Attention 
Thank the person for their attention, saying, "Thank you for caring enough to 
notice this issue and bringing it to my attention." Show gratitude for them not 
keeping their concerns to themselves. 
 
For example, if a regular customer criticizes a product they purchased from you, 
say, "I appreciate that you cared enough to bring this issue to my attention. I'm 
sorry that this time the product you received couldn't satisfy you like previous 
ones." 
 
You can see that you can express gratitude in various ways. 
 
Step 3: Expressing Regret 
Here, express regret only. Expressing regret is not equivalent to apologizing. 
Expressing regret means expressing your discomfort. For example, when sitting 
in a park, watching children play, and one of them falls hard to the ground, you 
feel regret, but it's not your fault. So, when criticized, express regret. 
 
For instance, my response to my student was, "I'm sorry that this issue has been 
bothering you. I feel regretful that you couldn't find satisfaction in my product 
this time." 
 
Notice how you can express regret in different ways. 
 
Stage Four: Asking Questions 
 
To understand why your counterpart feels this way, ask them for an 
explanation. Inquire about what exactly has caused them distress and 
discomfort. What has made them feel that their rights have been violated? For 
example, what did the product lack that it had in the previous version? Can you 
explain it to me? Can you tell me specifically which of my actions have triggered 
such feelings in you? 
 
Stage Five: Compensation 
 
This is where you make amends or provide an explanation. If you see that the 
other person is genuinely right and the issue is fixable, offer compensation. 
Explain the decision you've made based on a valid reason, at the very least. I'll 
explain why I wear these formal and monochromatic clothes: it's because I don't 
want my students to be distracted during my classes. However, nothing is more 
important than focusing on the class content and techniques. 
 
Regarding that product, you can say: "To compensate, what do you think I can 
do to help? Often, you can ask the person directly: "Would you like to bring the 
product, and we can examine it together, or would you like a discount for the 
next purchase to see if we can improve next time? We will definitely consider 
your feedback. Would you like to return the product and get a refund, or would 
you prefer to choose another one? I want to make it right for you.
