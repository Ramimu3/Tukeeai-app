 However, from my perspective, fixing the air 
conditioner was essential because I worked from home, and the heat made it 
impossible to concentrate. 
 
The technician came and spent a few hours fixing it. When he was finished, I 
asked him how much I should pay him. I don't know why I asked this question. 
He said 800,000 Tomans. I was surprised and asked, "Why 800,000 Tomans?" He 
had said 400,000 Tomans was the cost of the part, and 400,000 Tomans was his 
fee. Now, I'm offering you a discount; just give me 700,000 Tomans. 
 
In those circumstances, this amount was really high for me, and perhaps if I had 
known the full amount from the beginning, I would have reconsidered. Why did I 
fall into this trap? Because I didn't know how to go through the details precisely. 
 
If I could go back to day one with my current skills, I would ask him: "What's the 
total amount I need to pay? I won't pay more. Are you sure?" I might even 
discuss other aspects of the job with him in detail. 
 
What Details Should You Go Through? 
 
My dear friends, with every agreement, every request you make to someone, 
you should go through the details with the other party from the very beginning. 
This way, you'll fully understand the conditions, and you won't allow your rights 
to be violated later. 
 
Precise Timing Technique 
 
First and foremost, you must ensure that precise timing is established. When 
you order something from someone, make sure the timing is clear. Whether it's 
for repairing your house, buying furniture, preparing for a party, or ordering a 
piece for your business. If timing matters to you, make sure it's precise. When 
will you deliver it to me? 
 
I needed a translation of an article for my thesis. With the precise timing 
technique, I should have known when the translation would be in my hands. I 
had a presentation scheduled for the following Thursday. I told the translator, "If 
it's not in my hands by Wednesday, it's practically useless." 
 
You've lent money to someone. You must ask them precisely when they will 
repay it. If you're owed money, make sure to talk to them and say: 
 
- When are you going to return it to me? 
- By the end of next week. 
- My dear, "the end of next week" is too vague. For many, the end of the week 
starts on Thursday. Some consider Friday at midnight as the end of the week. 
When exactly is the end of the week for you? Thursday, by the close of business? 
Because I have plans for Friday, but it seems you're not sure when I'll get my 
money. 
 
When you hire someone for a job in your home, like a painter, make it clear from 
the beginning: "So, you'll deliver the house to me in 4 days." But you don't go 
through with it. Unfortunately, they damage a part of the work. They know your 
work is stuck with them. They move on to a couple of other projects, and they 
return to your job next week. 
 
When ordering furniture, you've probably experienced that they take the full 
payment, claiming it's necessary for the work. They say it'll be ready next week, 
but then they don't give you a proper answer for a month. Go through the 
timing precisely from the start, so you know exactly when it will be in your 
hands, down to the day and hour. 
 
Precise Payment Terms 
 
The second thing you must clarify right from the start is the precise payment 
terms. If you're taking on a project or starting any work, you should ask about 
your exact compensation. 
 
We often used to issue calls for interns multiple times a year for those who 
wanted to work in our professional environment and acquire skills. The 
internship opportunity is our social responsibility to allow talented young 
women to gain skills and enter the job market faster. But right from the 
beginning, we tell them: the internship process lasts for several months, and if 
you meet certain standards, you'll continue to work with us and receive a certain 
salary. If we can specify the time and amount from the beginning, so can others. 
Because, in my view, it's your right.
