 For example, 
when you want to blink, several neurons from the brain's motor center move 
and transmit themselves to the cells responsible for controlling eyelids in the 
brain. Then, these neurons move back from the brain to reach the eyelid 
muscles and influence them, causing you to blink. 
 
The first time you do this, it's challenging for the brain because it hasn't traveled 
this pathway before. Neurons struggle to find their way, and they might even 
get lost along the path! 
 
However, every time you repeat an activity, neurons find the route more quickly 
and reach their destination more easily. From a certain point onward, your brain 
gets to work and builds a pathway for that specific activity. When you repeat 
this activity more often, your brain paves the way further. 
 
In your brain, a so-called neuronal pathway has formed for the desired activity. 
Consequently, you become accustomed to an activity when a strong neural 
connection is established between the required nerve cells. 
 
When you decide to learn a new skill, like driving, it's only challenging for you 
until neurons learn their way in your brain and create a specific neuronal 
pathway. From then on, perhaps after 20 or even 40 days, you may find yourself 
driving without even concentrating on it. 
 
Any skill you practice correctly becomes a habit. What skill would you like to 
turn into a habit? You just need to find the right way to practice it and commit to 
it until its neuronal pathway is established. The key to practicing the right way is 
what you learn in this book about becoming a confident woman. 
 
2 Specific Eye Contact Exercises 
 
I want to mention two main exercises to create and make eye contact a 
automatic habit through building the neuronal pathway. Do these exercises 
every day. Allocate just 2-3 minutes for them daily, and see how you truly 
transform into someone who, like TV hosts and movie actors, establishes strong 
and effective eye contact with others. 
 
The first exercise is practicing eye contact in front of a mirror. I'm asking you to 
look into the mirror and talk to yourself for about a minute. The first and second 
times may feel quite strange. The fact that you're talking to yourself in the 
mirror is strange, isn't it? But do you know what's even stranger? It's that you 
can't even make eye contact with yourself. 
 
However, after a few weeks of practicing this conversation in front of the mirror 
for a minute every day, you'll start to feel the changes. This exercise helps eye 
contact gradually become a habit for you, and when you're talking to other 
people, you can establish this eye contact. 
 
The second exercise involves practicing eye contact with a live picture. This 
means doing the same thing you wanted to do with a mirror but now with the 
image of a real person. It could be your own image or an image of someone you 
deeply care about and value. This makes the exercise easier and more enjoyable 
for you. Look into their eyes and have a conversation with them. 
 
This exercise is somewhat strange as well, but someone who continues this 
practice consistently for one or two weeks begins to see its daily impact. You'll 
realize that people are starting to take your words more seriously, that people 
stop and listen to you. 
 
Previously, when you talked to someone, they were quite indifferent, and you 
didn't know why. But now that you're practicing eye contact, people stop and 
pay attention to you seriously. You'll understand how effective this exercise has 
been. This exercise is intended to build the neuronal pathway for eye contact. 
 
 
Practice Before Entering Society 
 
You might have wondered if it's really possible to practice on our own and 
improve our skills. A lady wrote on a piece of paper between seminars for me: 
 
"If we want to be confident, we need to be in society. But when we're in society, 
we can't behave properly, and we become introverted. What should we do?" 
 
You might tell yourself, "I can't demonstrate these techniques in front of people.
