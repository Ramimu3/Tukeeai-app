 Mirzaei, 
you came from a small town, create the largest women's educational platform 
and host the busiest training courses, how did you that? Years ago, many people 
asked me these questions and said, 'How did you have the courage?'" 
How did I have the courage? 
Ladies, when I became a business consultant for women, this profession was 
primarily dominated by men. Men who had their offices in Jordan, wearing 
Rolex watches and suits, coming in so confidently. On the other hand, a girl 
coming from a small town dressed modestly and using a taxi for transportation, 
didn't seem to have a place there. When they asked me where my office was, I 
couldn't help but laugh because I didn't have an office. However, I achieved 
results for my clients that many men hadn't. That's why they ask me, "How did 
you have so much courage?" 
Tonight, I'm going to share the path that brought me here with you; a path that 
15,000 of my students who attended the LadyBoss educational workshops have 
used and become confident ladies. Now, in this chapter, I'm giving you access to 
this path. 
I want to share my own story with you. I was a girl from the southern culture of 
the Iran, with the same traditional values of those regions. But I was very 
hopeful and eager for progress. I realized that I needed to become independent 
and create some distance. The only way I knew was to come to Tehran for 
further studies. So, I studied again to be accepted for a master's degree in 
industrial engineering in Tehran. My family strongly opposed it. 
As soon as I arrived in Tehran, I sought an engineering job to lessen the 
opposition; however, I quickly realized that the life of an employee was not what 
I wanted, and so I resigned. Suddenly, all the problems came crashing down on 
me. 
 
 
Real Challenges Begin 
Tonight, I want to focus on this part of my life because, for me, the journey to 
becoming a confident lady started right here. It was here that I managed to 
overcome my passiveness. I left my office job and started working in sales 
because I didn't want my income to be tied to hourly work. In sales, I had the 
opportunity to earn income based on my abilities. 
 
I got into insurance sales, a job that initially had no salary or income. When my 
family found out that I had left my engineering career, they strongly opposed it 
and withdrew both emotional and financial support. This made my 
circumstances much tougher. I had no income, no support, and in Tehran, I 
didn't know anyone. When I started my job, I realized that I lacked any skills. 
 
The first thing I did was to acquire various skills and attend various classes. And 
by skills, I don't just mean negotiation and customer acquisition. I even learned 
web design, and I've been doing the initial website designs for LadyBoss myself. 
I learned content creation, Instagram marketing, and attended business 
coaching courses. Over the course of six years, my business grew and became 
more successful. 
 
A very important point is that if I were the same Razieh from two years ago, 
living in the south of the country in the years 1392 and 1393, none of these 
things would ever have happened to me, and I would never have grown so 
much. But what really happened? Tonight, I'll tell you about it. 
 
What happened? 
I told you that almost a year after coming to Tehran, I resigned. I became 
financially broke, and I lost all emotional and financial support from my family. 
However, these were not my major problems. My bigger problem was that I 
didn't know anything about the principles and intricacies of my job. I realized 
that I needed essential skills to advance my business. I didn't know many people 
in Tehran. I needed to meet new people and build strong relationships, but I 
couldn't. I needed to offer my services and products to different people to 
become my clients, but I couldn't. I needed to ask people to invest in me, to 
become my partners, to guide me, and to provide me with better products and 
services. 
 
Yes, I needed to ask, but I couldn't. Why couldn't I?
