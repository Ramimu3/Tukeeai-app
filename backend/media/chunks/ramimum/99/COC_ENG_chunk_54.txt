Why the 5-Step Technique 
 
With this 5-step technique, you turn any criticism that comes your way into a 
gift. The beauty of this approach is that it improves your relationship with the 
other person, creating a space for them to speak their mind, while you don't get 
caught up in mental turmoil over the criticism. It's not like that criticism will 
haunt your thoughts for weeks. Right there, with the 5-step conversation, your 
mood also gets better. Most importantly, you gain insight from it like a gift and 
a gold coin. 
 
Many have asked why criticism often isn't based on reality. The person doesn't 
know everything and is making judgments based on a limited view. Yet, because 
they've seen just a part of the story, they judge based on that, and it upsets 
them. 
 
A few days ago, we received a message: "Mrs. Mirzaei, why don't you have 
support in the academy? Why don't you hire more support staff? I sent a 
message yesterday, and I still haven't received a response." 
 
The issue is that this person doesn't know that my colleagues were working in 
the office and responding to queries until Friday evening. They don't know that 
just last week, we hired more than ten new employees, yet the message volume 
is still high. The pace of our managers' growth is much faster than that of the 
academy. However, it doesn't matter what the truth is; what matters is that 
their perception of us has soured. And if you, as a manager, are in this situation, 
you can't dismiss it with indifference. 
 
You need to learn how to improve people's perceptions. This criticism 
management framework helps you become better, and often we ask these 
people, "If you were in our shoes, what would your solution be to improve our 
support process, dear madam? What's your suggestion for us? How can I 
compensate to make you feel better about the academy?" 
 
Many times, this same situation occurs in interactions between employees and 
employers. The employee says, "I put my heart into it, but my manager keeps 
criticizing." 
 
I tell them: "The truth doesn't matter. What matters is that this person's feelings 
toward you have soured, and you need to make an effort to rebuild this 
relationship; otherwise, you might face consequences. So, remember this in 
criticisms: feelings are more important than facts. The person criticizing you is 
upset with you, and yet, it was important enough for them to bring it up. So, you 
should see this as an opportunity. 
 
Written Exercise 
 
I want to give you three scenarios. Take three minutes right now and write down 
the 5 steps. Well, the first step is listening, and you don't need to write that. 
Write down the rest. I've selected three questions. We've all encountered them 
or will definitely encounter them, and it's great to practice them now so you'll 
have them ready in your mind. 
 
First, how long have you been putting up with your job? Your spouse might ask 
this. 
 
... 
Second, your behavior with other customers is not the same as before. You used 
to be very friendly. Now, it seems like you're not the same. 
 
... 
Third, your competitors are making a lot of progress. I'm thinking of coming 
back to you. 
 
... 
The Final Stop 
 
The book you're reading has two main advantages over all the books available in 
Iran for overcoming shyness and building self-confidence in communication. 
 
The first advantage: this book is designed exclusively for women. To create this 
book, we participated in over 10 international workshops. We read over 100 
books, and we interviewed over 1,000 successful women. We provide you with 
teachings that we are confident are completely practical and curated specifically 
for you, ladies. 
 
The second advantage: we wrote this book as a workshop, meaning we had 
both in-book exercises and external exercises as a gift, all of which helped you 
see the effects of the teachings in your life, chapter by chapter. 
 
I urge you to take the exercises seriously. Alongside all the classes you attend 
and books you read, continue practicing.
