 
 
Some might be happy with this proposal, but you may be very sensitive about 
your home, especially if they say you shouldn't be there, implying that you're 
not invited. On one hand, you want to refuse, but on the other hand, you're 
worried that refusing might break the relationship, and maintaining the 
relationship is important to you. What is the right course of action? 
 
We have to gather our courage from these everyday behaviors so that we can be 
courageous in life's pivotal moments. Now, write your own examples:

Behavior Analysis Exercise 
 
In any situation, we can have three behavior models: 
 
1. Assertive behavior 
2. Passive or timid behavior 
3. Aggressive behavior 
 
One of the very effective exercises that helps you become proficient in assertive 
behavior is to analyze different situations: 
 
1. If I were to act timid, what would I do? 
2. If I wanted to act aggressively, what would I do? 
3. Ultimately, what is my assertive behavior? 
 
Do this exercise extensively because it truly helps you quickly build the neural 
pathway for assertiveness. 
 
We Have Three Behavior Models 
 
Let's illustrate with an example. You have bought some items and now want to 
return them. How do you behave? 
 
Based on the behavior criteria, naturally, it's your legal right not to return the 
items you have bought and realized you don't want. This is your natural right all 
around the world. 
 
The first behavior is aggressive. For example, you throw the items in front of the 
seller and say: 
 
"What is this you've given us? The same items are half the price in the market. 
It's 50,000 Tomans cheaper. Your items don't even have the quality. Why did 
you treat me like I don't understand? Did you really think you could survive with 
this kind of behavior for a few years here? Do you really think people are 
laughing at you? This is how you are now." 
 
But well, an overly aggressive person does this. They exaggerate to the point 
where the other person loses respect and they say, "Take your money and go!" 
 
The second behavior is timid. For example, you say: 
 
"Sir, I'm really sorry. I made a mistake a few days ago buying these items from 
you. It was my own foolishness. I didn't realize I didn't want these. Now I'm in 
serious trouble. I need this money for my sister; she's very sick. Please take 
these items back so I can pay the hospital. I really need it." 
 
You probably tell four lies as well. For example, you say your sister is very ill and 
you need the money for the hospital. Then, please remove the items from me so 
I can pay the hospital. I really need it. 
 
See? A timid person talks like this. They tell a thousand lies and play a role. 
 
The third behavior is assertiveness. For example, you say: 
 
"Hello. I bought these items from you a few days ago, but I've calculated and 
realized that we have more than we need. We won't be able to use these items. I 
would appreciate it if you could take them back." 
 
*Note for better learning: As you read the examples, it might be helpful to ask 
yourself, "What would I say if I were in their place?" 
 
Mistaken Teacher 
 
A teacher says something that I believe is wrong. What should I do? 
 
I stand up and say, "Excuse me, ma'am, what nonsense are you talking about? 
Do you think people don't understand? I have understood that what you're 
saying is completely wrong. I'm sorry that you're wasting people's time and 
talking nonsense like this. It's not the way you're saying it, and..." 
 
What behavior is this? Aggression. 
 
Alternatively, I might sit quietly and say nothing. Worse yet, I might mumble 
under my breath, saying, "When I leave the class tomorrow, I'll tell four of my 
friends and acquaintances: yeah, so-and-so said some nonsense and left. I'm not 
going to their classes anymore." 
 
What behavior is this? Passiveness. 
 
Criticism in a group setting is generally wrong.
